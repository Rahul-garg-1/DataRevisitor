All of that appealed to me.”,Research Associate, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore,Alumni, IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Physics,Eisenstein Group,PhD, 2012,Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore,View my Videos,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,I’m studying graphene, a unique material made up of a single layer of carbon atoms. It conducts heat and electricity very well and is the thinnest and strongest material we know of, so it has many potential applications. It has many other bizarre and intriguing properties, and the scientists who were the first to prepare it in a single layer and describe some of its unusual characteristics won the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics. My experiments focus on how electrons move and interact in graphene, a phenomenon we don’t understand very well. We’d like to know whether their behavior is correlated—in other words, if you have electron movement over here, does it affect what electrons are doing over there, and how do the electrons influence each other across these distances? This is fundamental physics research, but gaining a deeper understanding of graphene’s electrical properties will also help us to envision and develop applications.,What drew you to this work?,In high school I knew that I wanted to study physics, and in college I was originally attracted to astrophysics and quantum field theory—you know, you read popular science books and everyone wants to be Feynman! But soon after I started my master’s program at IISc I did my first condensed matter physics experiment, and discovered how much I enjoyed the whole process—the hands-on aspect of preparing your own samples, collaborating across disciplines with materials scientists, and looking at the properties of new materials where you really don’t know what you’re going to find. All of that appealed to me.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,Back in Bangalore I was very active with a program called Notebook Drive that creates educational opportunities for underprivileged children. We teach in the primary schools and provide them with books, take students on science field trips, and organize other activities to encourage them to stay in school. After getting my PhD I spent several months working on a project jointly funded by the Indian government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a lab-on-a chip diagnostic device for use in rural India. Since coming to Caltech, I’ve been involved in Caltech OASIS (Organization of Associated Students of the Indian Subcontinent). I like hiking, reading contemporary fiction, and cooking—traditional Indian and a bit of Italian,I was surprised to find that most people don’t cook so much here.

Cavities with a small Veff and a high Q offer the promise for applications in nonlinear optics, sensing, and cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED). Chip-based devices are particularly appealing, as planar fabrication technology can be used to make optical structures on a semiconductor chip that confine light to wavelength-scale dimensions, thereby creating strong enough electric fields that even a single photon can have an appreciable interaction with matter. When combined with the potential for integration and scalability inherent to microphotonic structures created by planar fabrication techniques, these devices have enormous potential for future generations of experiments in cavity QED and quantum networks.,This thesis is largely focused on the development of ultrasmall Veff, high-Q semiconductor optical microcavities. In particular, we present work that addresses two major topics of relevance when trying to observe coherent quantum interactions within these semiconductor-based systems: (1) the demonstration of low optical losses in a wavelength-scale microcavity, and (2) the development of an efficient optical channel through which the sub-micron-scale optical field in the microcavity can be accessed. The two microcavities of specific interest are planar photonic crystal defect resonators and microdisk resonators.,The first part of this thesis details the development of photonic crystal defect microcavities. A momentum space analysis is used to design structures in graded square and hexagonal lattice photonic crystals that not only sustain high Qs and small Veffs, but are also relatively robust to imperfections. These designs are then implemented in a number of experiments, starting with device fabrication in an InAsP/InGaAsP multi-quantum-well material to create low-threshold lasers with Qs of 1.3x10^4, and followed by fabrication in a silicon-on-insulator system to create passive resonators with Qs as high as 4.0x10^4. In the latter experiments, an optical fiber taper waveguide is used to couple light into and out of the cavities, and we demonstrate its utility as an optical probe that provides spectral and spatial information about the cavity modes. For a cavity mode with Q ~ 4x10^4, we demonstrate mode localization data consistent with Veff ~ 0.9(λ/n)^3.,In the second part of this thesis, we describe experiments in a GaAs/AlGaAs material containing self-assembled InAs quantum dots. Small diameter microdisk cavities are fabricated with Q ~ 3.6x10^5 and Veff ~ 6(λ/n)^3, and with Q ~ 1.2x10^5 and Veff ~ 2(λ/n)^3. These devices are used to create room-temperature, continuous-wave, optically pumped lasers with thresholds as low as 1μW of absorbed pump power. Optical fiber tapers are used to efficiently collect emitted light from the devices, and a laser differential efficiency as high as 16% is demonstrated. Furthermore, these microdisk cavities have the requisite combination of high Q and small Veff to enable strong coupling to a single InAs quantum dot, in that the achievable coupling rate between the quantum dot and a single photon in the cavity is predicted to exceed the decay rates within the system. Quantum master equation simulations of the expected behavior of such fiber-coupled devices are presented, and progress towards such cavity QED experiments is described.,Item Type:,Thesis (Dissertation (Ph.D.)),Subject Keywords:,optical resonators; photonic crystals; quantum optics; semiconductor lasers,Degree Grantor:,California Institute of Technology,Division:,Engineering and Applied Science,Major Option:,Applied Physics,Thesis Availability:,Public (worldwide access),Research Advisor(s):,Painter, Oskar J.,Thesis Committee:,Painter, Oskar J.

Current detector technologies already have sensitivities limited by the noise due to photon arrival statistics. To further improve the sensitivity and mapping speed of experiments for a wide field survey, focal planes containing tens of thousands of pixels are required. Unfortunately, the current technologies use discrete and massive components which are not easy to integrate into large arrays. This thesis presents a 16-pixel, two-color, submillimeter-wave, prototype camera developed at Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using a novel photon detector technology. The camera also uses new designs for other constituent elements – the antenna, transmission line feednetwork, and bandpass filters – to implement the sub-millimeter pixels. These designs allow integration of the entire camera onto a single chip and conclusively address the problem of scalability while maintaining the sensitivity and noise performance of the current technologies. This thesis explains the design of each of these components and presents the results from experiments conducted to test their performance. Results from the 'first light', obtained by mounting the prototype camera onto the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), are also presented.,We have also studied the temperature and power dependence of the resonance frequency, quality factor, and frequency noise of the superconducting niobium thin-film coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators in order to understand the factors affecting the noise performance of our photon detectors. These experiments were carried out at temperatures well below the superconducting transition (Tc = 9.2 K) in an attempt to understand the source of the excess frequency noise of superconducting resonators which form the sensing element of our photon detectors. The noise decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude as the temperature is increased from 120 to 1200 mK, while the variation of the resonance frequency with temperature over this range agrees well with the standard two-level systems (TLS) model for amorphous dielectrics. These results support the hypothesis that TLS are responsible for the noise in superconducting microresonators and have important implications for resonator applications such as qubits and photon detectors.,Item Type:,Thesis (Dissertation (Ph.D.)),Subject Keywords:,bandpass filters; superconducting resonators,Degree Grantor:,California Institute of Technology,Division:,Engineering and Applied Science,Major Option:,Applied Physics,Thesis Availability:,Public (worldwide access),Research Advisor(s):,Zmuidzinas, Jonas,Group:,Caltech Submillimeter Observatory, Astronomy Department,Thesis Committee:,Rutledge, David B.

Tyson, Sr., Professor of Mechanics and Materials Science, will become one of Caltech's two vice provosts. He takes on the role filled for the last six years by,Mory Gharib,, the Hans W. Liepmann Professor of Aeronautics and Bioinspired Engineering. Gharib will continue to serve as director of the Graduate Aerospace Laboratories (GALCIT) and the recently established Center for Autonomous Systems and Technology.,Bhattacharya joined the Division of Engineering and Applied Science (EAS) faculty in 1993. His research group studies the mechanical behavior of solids and uses theory to guide the development of new materials. He has made contributions on a wide array of topics, ranging from the fundamental mechanics of materials, to active materials and devices, to multi-scale and multi-physics scale simulation of materials. Though trained as a theoretician, he is well known for live demonstrations of shape-memory materials in action.,Bhattacharya was executive officer of the mechanical and civil engineering department from 2007 to 2015, overseeing the department's academic program and the,renovation of the Charles C. Gates Jr.–Franklin Thomas Laboratory,As vice provost, he will focus on overseeing sponsored research policies and proposal authorizations, human subject policies and procedures, the technology transfer and corporate relations program, and research compliance. Caltech's other vice provost,,Cindy Weinstein,, professor of English, focuses on academic matters. ""I have great confidence in Kaushik and am very pleased that he has agreed to take on the job of vice provost,"" says,Ed Stolper,, Caltech's provost and the William E. Leonhard Professor of Geology and Carl and Shirley Larson Provostial Chair. ""I am confident that he, Cindy Weinstein, and I will function as an effective team carrying out the diverse tasks of the provost's office."",""Caltech is a special place and I look forward to the opportunity to assist my colleagues in their pursuit of excellence in research and innovation,"" says Bhattacharya.,""Kaushik's technical strength, deep knowledge of the Institute, energy, and enthusiasm will serve him and us well as he takes on this important role,"" says,Guruswami (Ravi) Ravichandran,, the John E. Goode, Jr., Professor of Aerospace and Mechanical Engineering and Otis Booth Leadership Chair of the EAS division.,Bhattacharya received his PhD from the University of Minnesota in 1991 and was a postdoctoral scholar at the Courant Institute for Mathematical Sciences from 1991 to 1993. He is a recipient of several honors and awards, including the Warner T. Koiter Medal of the American Society of Mechanical Engineering, the Young Investigator Prize from the Society of Engineering Science, the Special Achievements Award in Applied Mechanics from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, and the National Science Foundation Young Investigator Award. In 2013, Bhattacharya received Caltech's annual Graduate Student Council Teaching and Mentoring Award. He served as editor of the,Journal of Mechanics and Physics of Solids,from 2005 to 2015.,""I want to thank Mory Gharib for his six years of service as vice provost,"" Stolper says. ""In my opinion, Mory's deep knowledge of Caltech; his instincts in interacting with his fellow faculty members regarding sometimes contentious issues; his understanding of issues associated with technology transfer and interactions with industry based on his many successful experiences in this realm; his leadership in the establishment of the Linde Institute of Economic and Management Sciences; and his intuition for resolving potentially difficult conflicts of interest have all resulted in unique and lasting contributions to the Caltech community for which we all, and I in particular, owe him our thanks."",Written by,Lorinda Dajose,Kaushik Bhattacharya,Credit: Courtesy of EAS Communications Office/Caltech,Image Lightbox,Kaushik Bhattacharya,Credit: Courtesy of EAS Communications Office/Caltech,Download Full Image,Subscribe,The Caltech Weekly,Share this,Tags,Institute affairs,Related Links,>,Weinstein Begins Duties as New Vice Provost,See All News,>,California Institute of Technology,1200 East California Boulevard,Pasadena, California 91125,Contact Us,Claimed Copyright Infringement,Privacy Notice,Site content Copyright @ 2020","https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=216652915781085&ev=PageView&noscript=1,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-chevron-grey-550.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-chevron-orange.png,/static/core/img/caltech-new-logo.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-search.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/menu-burger.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-search.png,https://caltech-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/main/images/KBhattacharya-9520-RV-NEWS-WEB.width-450.jpg,https://caltech-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/main/images/KBhattacharya-9520-RV-NEWS-WEB.max-1400x800.jpg,/static/airspace/img/icon-chevron-orange.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/flame.png,/static/core/img/caltech-new-logo.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-footerpin.png",https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/bhattacharya-named-vice-provost-51316

She and her colleagues have developed robotic surveys to help detect these transient events, and she has built a global network of collaborators and telescopes aimed at capturing details of the flashes at all wavelengths.,Kasliwal grew up in Indore, India, and came to the United States to study at the age of 15. She earned her BS at Cornell University and then came to Caltech to complete her doctoral work in astronomy. She completed a postdoctoral fellowship at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena before returning to Caltech as a faculty member in September.,We sat down with Kasliwal to discuss her passion for discovering and studying these cosmic transients as well as her recent efforts to follow up on,LIGO's detections of gravitational waves,What do you actually,see,when you discover a cosmic transient?,You see a flash of light on the screen and then you see it disappear—often it's gone in a few days or even a few hours. In that short time, you try to get at the chemistry of the event. You try to take the light from the flash and disperse it; once you get a spectrum, you can tell what sorts of elements it's actually made of.,So, I search for these cosmic transients, try to understand what they are all about, and look for new types of them.,What types of events produce these flashes?,The most common varieties of these flashes are novae and supernovae. Novae are produced by nuclear explosions on stellar remnants called white dwarfs, while core-collapse supernovae are related to the deaths of massive stars. Novae are about a million times the brightness of the sun, and supernovae are a billion times as bright. For a long time we didn't know of anything in between, but today we know of many classes of transients with luminosities between novae and supernovae that involve mergers between these crazy objects. That's where a lot of the most interesting stellar physics happens—when something like a white dwarf smashes into a neutron star or a neutron star smashes into a black hole.,These are extreme events, and it turns out that a lot of the chemical elements that we see around us are synthesized in these explosions. For example, when I was doing my PhD thesis here, I found a rare class of events that generates about half of the calcium in the universe. For decades, people had wondered where all the calcium was made because there was much more of it around than supernovae alone could synthesize. We found this group of very rare explosions. We call them calcium-rich gap transients because they appear to be the mines in the universe where calcium is made.,Are they exploding stars?,We actually don't know. Our best guess is that they are some sort of white dwarf–neutron star merger. We now have a sample of about eight of these events and have been able to quantify the calcium made in each, showing that even though these events are rare, each one produces so much calcium that, as a class, they can account for the missing calcium.,On what does your research currently focus?,Right now I'm looking for the cosmic mines of the heavy elements. If you look at the periodic table, about half of the elements heavier than iron—things like gold, platinum, and uranium—are produced by something called r-process nucleosynthesis. We know these elements are produced by this process, but astronomers still don't know where this process takes place. We've never seen it in action. None of the explosions that we've found so far has been extreme enough to actually synthesize enough heavy elements.,What types of events might produce these heavy elements?,Theoretically, we expect that the most extreme events involve a neutron star merging with a black hole or with another neutron star—because neutron stars and black holes are much denser than white dwarfs, for example. But these explosions are extremely rare. They happen maybe once per 10,000 years per galaxy. By comparison, novae are easy to find because there are about 20 of those per year per galaxy. Supernovae are harder, but they still happen about once per century per galaxy.,To look for these rarer and more exotic events, you need the next generation of surveys and telescopes. Your response needs to be quick. The flash of light happens very rarely, it lasts for a very short time, and it's dim. So you have the worst of all worlds when you're trying to find them.,To overcome this challenge, we are working in close collaboration with Advanced LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory with enhanced detectors to try to detect ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by such extreme events). The idea is that Advanced LIGO will ""hear"" the gravitational sound waves, and our surveys at Palomar Observatory, currently the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), and eventually the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), will see the light from the binary neutron-star merger.,Were you involved in efforts to follow up on Advanced LIGO's recent detection of gravitational waves? What did you see?,I am leading the Caltech effort to look for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves. PTF responded automatically and promptly to the gravitational wave alerts from LIGO and imaged hundreds of square degrees of the localization that was accessible from Palomar Observatory. Within minutes, we reduced our data, and within hours we orchestrated a global follow-up campaign for our most promising candidates—the brightest flashes that could have possibly correlated with the LIGO detection. We obtained spectroscopic follow-up of our candidates from the Keck and Gemini observatories, radio follow-up from the Very Large Array, and X-ray follow-up from the Swift satellite. None of our candidates was related to the gravitational wave trigger, which is what you would expect for a merger of two black holes.,Finding the electromagnetic counterpart to a merger between two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole could identify the cosmic mines of heavy elements such as gold and platinum. It is very exciting that this much-awaited gold rush has actually begun!,Can you talk more about PTF and ZTF and also address how you first became interested in this field?,When I came to grad school and took my first course, the known explosions were of two types: novae and supernovae. I thought, ""Nature's more creative than that."",For my PhD thesis, we came up with a plan-A, a plan-B, and a plan-C for how to search for events in between, and the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) was plan-D.,For PTF, we roboticized a couple of telescopes at Palomar Observatory and imaged huge swaths of sky over and over again, looking for things that changed. Because we were imaging such a large area at such a rapid rate, we actually began finding these very rare flashes of light.,Now we're working hard on ZTF, which should come online in 2017. It is an order of magnitude more sensitive than PTF and hence poised to uncover rarer events. Instead of a seven-square-degree camera, we have a 47-square-degree camera; instead of taking 40 seconds to read out the camera, it will take less than 15 seconds.,Are you working on other projects?,I am leading a couple of projects. The first is a project called SPIRITS, which stands for the SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey. We are looking for infrared transients. Although there are many surveys at optical wavelengths, the infrared is completely pristine. It's like going off fishing in new waters.,We use the Spitzer Space Telescope and a bunch of ground-based observatories to take images in the infrared of 242 nearby galaxies on different timescales. Most of what I'm finding so far seems to be mergers of individual massive stars and the births of binaries, which you can only see in the infrared because they form in a red cloud of gas and dust.,This is a Spitzer Exploration Science Program, which means we've been granted more than 1,300 hours of time on the space telescope to do this in a very big way over three years.,And the other project?,I'm also the principal investigator on the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen) project that was,recently funded,by the National Science Foundation's Partnerships in International Research and Education program. Our network includes six U.S. universities and six foreign countries spanning the globe to observe transients before they fade away, beating sunrise.,In building this network, we went both for telescopes that would make sense for the network and for people who would enjoy this type of science. It is not for everyone. It's nerve-wracking—you're doing work at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., and if you drop the ball, it's a pretty big deal. We tried to pick coinvestigators who are sufficiently excited about the science so that when they wake up, they aren't in a grumpy mood.,Outside of your research, are you passionate about any other activities?,There is a wonderful organization called Asha, which means hope, which runs schools for underprivileged children in India. To me education is the solution to many of the problems in India. I've been helping Asha with fundraising and setting up these schools. When I go back home, I try to visit the Asha schools. When you meet the children and see that they are actually getting an education and have dreams … it feels good. It's small, but it matters.,Written by,Kimm Fesenmaier,Contact,Deborah Williams-Hedges,(626) 395‑3227,debwms@caltech.edu,Mansi Kasliwal, assistant professor of astronomy, holding one of the 16 large-format detectors that will be part of the Zwicky Transient Facility camera mosaic.,Credit: Lance Hayashida/Caltech,Image Lightbox,Mansi Kasliwal, assistant professor of astronomy, holding one of the 16 large-format detectors that will be part of the Zwicky Transient Facility camera mosaic.,Credit: Lance Hayashida/Caltech,Download Full Image,Subscribe,The Caltech Weekly,Share this,Tags,astronomy & physics,faculty profile,Related Links,>,NSF Supports Caltech-Led Global Project to Study Cosmic Flashes,See All News,>,California Institute of Technology,1200 East California Boulevard,Pasadena, California 91125,Contact Us,Claimed Copyright Infringement,Privacy Notice,Site content Copyright @ 2020","https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=216652915781085&ev=PageView&noscript=1,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-chevron-grey-550.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-chevron-orange.png,/static/core/img/caltech-new-logo.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-search.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/menu-burger.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-search.png,https://caltech-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/main/images/Kasliwal-Mansi-8133-RT-NEWS-WEB.width-450.jpg,https://caltech-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/main/images/Kasliwal-Mansi-8133-RT-NEWS-WEB.max-1400x800.jpg,/static/airspace/img/icon-chevron-orange.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/flame.png,/static/core/img/caltech-new-logo.png,/static/theme-v7.0/img/icon-footerpin.png",https://www.caltech.edu:443/about/news/hunting-ephemeral-cosmic-flashes-conversation-mansi-kasliwal-49782
