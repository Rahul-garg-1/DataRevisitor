Catalysis, its practice and its concepts, will remain relevant as we respond to changes in feedstock availability and type. With this mindset, our group focuses on the molecular-level description and control of catalytic chemistries relevant for the transformation of transitional sources of fuels and feedstocks such as natural gas and biomass..,The functional characterization of reactivity is accomplished by isotopic tracer and transient studies, chemical transient methods, and steady-state kinetic measurements to determine the evolution of surface species and reaction intermediates prevalent under reaction conditions. These kinetics and mechanistic studies are complemented by general structural and chemical characterization studies using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, porosity measurements, thermal analysis techniques and infrared and NMR spectroscopies.  In intimate collaboration with these experimental studies, computational studies using Density Functional Theory (DFT) are done to examine molecule-surface interactions and chemical rearrangements relevant for these chemistries.,Our integrated experimental/ theoretical approach lies at the crossroads of materials synthesis, computational catalysis and catalytic chemistry and aims to advance our ability to understand, design and control chemical transformations using catalysis.,Awards,Shell Chair Professor in Chemical Engineering, 2018,Young Scientist Award, Acid Base Catalysis Society, 2017,Editor, Journal of Catalysis, 2017,Ipatieff Prize, American Chemical Society, 2016,Richard A.

The Academia Europaea was founded in 1988 and is an organization of eminent, individual scholars from across the continent of Europe. The 3000 members cover a wide range of academic disciplines including the humanities, social, physical and life sciences as well as mathematics, engineering and medicine. In addition to Professor Ravichandran, EAS Past Chair Ares Rosakis, Caltech's Provost Edward Stolper, the Institute's Past President David Baltimore, and Professor Alexander Varshavsky are members of the Academy.,Tags:,honors,GALCIT,MCE,Guruswami Ravichandran,Building the Artificially Intelligent Future,09-01-17,This fall, three graduate students will enter Caltech as Kortschak Scholars in,Computing and Mathematical Sciences,. They are the first students in the Kortschak Scholars program, a newly established endowment for incoming PhD students in computer science at Caltech. “We are grateful to the Kortschaks for their vision and generous support enabling our students to identify the research areas where their passion could have the biggest impact. The Kortschak Scholars will be attracted to Caltech by the opportunity to work at the leading edges of computing and mathematical sciences to invent the technologies of the future,” said EAS Chair G. Ravichandran.

""I believe, based on the evaluation of the search committee and on my own interactions with him, that Ravi not only has the judgment, energy, and vision to lead the division creatively and effectively, but that he will also be an outstanding advocate for the division,"" said,Edward Stolper,, Carl and Shirley Larson Provostial Chair and William E. Leonhard Professor of Geology, in an announcement to the EAS faculty. Professor Ravichandran commented, ""During my tenure, I would like to see that we attract the best faculty and students to EAS and the Institute who will enable interdisciplinary activities across Caltech and contribute to frontiers of engineering science and technology. I would like to see a more diverse body of students and faculty, who will enrich EAS and the Institute, and I would like to see EAS be at the forefront of technological revolution based on our unique ability to drive advances through basic research.” [,Caltech Release,],Tags:,honors,GALCIT,MCE,Guruswami Ravichandran,Edward Stolper,Dr. Rittel Recognized by Academy of Sciences of Turin,06-18-15,Dr. Daniel Rittel, long term GALCIT Visiting Associate working with Professors,Ravichandran,and,Rosakis,, has been awarded the 2015  “,Angiola Gili e Cataldo Agostinelli,” international prize for Applied or Theoretical Mechanics by the Academy of Sciences of Turin, Italy.    Dr. Rittel has performed pioneering research in the mechanics of materials, with particular focus on the coupling thermomechanical solids.  His work has demonstrated that the energy stored in the material is not only due to thermodynamic effects, but also due to changes in the microstructure identified as dynamic recrystallization.  His research has also led to a paradigm shift in the modeling of the localization phenomena of sliding dynamics, combining the science of materials with the mechanics using numerical simulations.
