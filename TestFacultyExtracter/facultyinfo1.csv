"(2008),Cryogenic photon detectors can be used to make extremely sensitive cameras for submillimeter astronomy. Current detector technologies already have sensitivities limited by the noise due to photon arrival statistics. To further improve the sensitivity and mapping speed of experiments for a wide field survey, focal planes containing tens of thousands of pixels are required. Unfortunately, the current technologies use discrete and massive components which are not easy to integrate into large arrays. This thesis presents a 16-pixel, two-color, submillimeter-wave, prototype camera developed at Caltech and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory using a novel photon detector technology. The camera also uses new designs for other constituent elements – the antenna, transmission line feednetwork, and bandpass filters – to implement the sub-millimeter pixels. These designs allow integration of the entire camera onto a single chip and conclusively address the problem of scalability while maintaining the sensitivity and noise performance of the current technologies. This thesis explains the design of each of these components and presents the results from experiments conducted to test their performance. Results from the 'first light', obtained by mounting the prototype camera onto the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), are also presented.,We have also studied the temperature and power dependence of the resonance frequency, quality factor, and frequency noise of the superconducting niobium thin-film coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonators in order to understand the factors affecting the noise performance of our photon detectors. These experiments were carried out at temperatures well below the superconducting transition (Tc = 9.2 K) in an attempt to understand the source of the excess frequency noise of superconducting resonators which form the sensing element of our photon detectors. The noise decreases by nearly two orders of magnitude as the temperature is increased from 120 to 1200 mK, while the variation of the resonance frequency with temperature over this range agrees well with the standard two-level systems (TLS) model for amorphous dielectrics. These results support the hypothesis that TLS are responsible for the noise in superconducting microresonators and have important implications for resonator applications such as qubits and photon detectors.,Repository Staff Only:","/images/new_cls_logo_60.gif,/images/codalogo.jpg,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1663/1.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/thesis.pdf,/images/eprintslogo.gif",http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1663/

"You see a flash of light on the screen and then you see it disappear—often it's gone in a few days or even a few hours. In that short time, you try to get at the chemistry of the event. You try to take the light from the flash and disperse it; once you get a spectrum, you can tell what sorts of elements it's actually made of.,So, I search for these cosmic transients, try to understand what they are all about, and look for new types of them.,The most common varieties of these flashes are novae and supernovae. Novae are produced by nuclear explosions on stellar remnants called white dwarfs, while core-collapse supernovae are related to the deaths of massive stars. Novae are about a million times the brightness of the sun, and supernovae are a billion times as bright. For a long time we didn't know of anything in between, but today we know of many classes of transients with luminosities between novae and supernovae that involve mergers between these crazy objects. That's where a lot of the most interesting stellar physics happens—when something like a white dwarf smashes into a neutron star or a neutron star smashes into a black hole.,These are extreme events, and it turns out that a lot of the chemical elements that we see around us are synthesized in these explosions. For example, when I was doing my PhD thesis here, I found a rare class of events that generates about half of the calcium in the universe. For decades, people had wondered where all the calcium was made because there was much more of it around than supernovae alone could synthesize. We found this group of very rare explosions. We call them calcium-rich gap transients because they appear to be the mines in the universe where calcium is made.,We actually don't know. Our best guess is that they are some sort of white dwarf–neutron star merger. We now have a sample of about eight of these events and have been able to quantify the calcium made in each, showing that even though these events are rare, each one produces so much calcium that, as a class, they can account for the missing calcium.,Right now I'm looking for the cosmic mines of the heavy elements. If you look at the periodic table, about half of the elements heavier than iron—things like gold, platinum, and uranium—are produced by something called r-process nucleosynthesis. We know these elements are produced by this process, but astronomers still don't know where this process takes place. We've never seen it in action. None of the explosions that we've found so far has been extreme enough to actually synthesize enough heavy elements.,Theoretically, we expect that the most extreme events involve a neutron star merging with a black hole or with another neutron star—because neutron stars and black holes are much denser than white dwarfs, for example. But these explosions are extremely rare. They happen maybe once per 10,000 years per galaxy. By comparison, novae are easy to find because there are about 20 of those per year per galaxy. Supernovae are harder, but they still happen about once per century per galaxy.,To look for these rarer and more exotic events, you need the next generation of surveys and telescopes. Your response needs to be quick. The flash of light happens very rarely, it lasts for a very short time, and it's dim. So you have the worst of all worlds when you're trying to find them.,To overcome this challenge, we are working in close collaboration with Advanced LIGO (the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory with enhanced detectors to try to detect ripples in the fabric of space-time caused by such extreme events). The idea is that Advanced LIGO will ""hear"" the gravitational sound waves, and our surveys at Palomar Observatory, currently the intermediate Palomar Transient Factory (PTF), and eventually the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), will see the light from the binary neutron-star merger.,I am leading the Caltech effort to look for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves. PTF responded automatically and promptly to the gravitational wave alerts from LIGO and imaged hundreds of square degrees of the localization that was accessible from Palomar Observatory. Within minutes, we reduced our data, and within hours we orchestrated a global follow-up campaign for our most promising candidates—the brightest flashes that could have possibly correlated with the LIGO detection. We obtained spectroscopic follow-up of our candidates from the Keck and Gemini observatories, radio follow-up from the Very Large Array, and X-ray follow-up from the Swift satellite. None of our candidates was related to the gravitational wave trigger, which is what you would expect for a merger of two black holes.,Finding the electromagnetic counterpart to a merger between two neutron stars or a neutron star and a black hole could identify the cosmic mines of heavy elements such as gold and platinum. It is very exciting that this much-awaited gold rush has actually begun!,When I came to grad school and took my first course, the known explosions were of two types: novae and supernovae. I thought, ""Nature's more creative than that."",For my PhD thesis, we came up with a plan-A, a plan-B, and a plan-C for how to search for events in between, and the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) was plan-D.,For PTF, we roboticized a couple of telescopes at Palomar Observatory and imaged huge swaths of sky over and over again, looking for things that changed. Because we were imaging such a large area at such a rapid rate, we actually began finding these very rare flashes of light.,Now we're working hard on ZTF, which should come online in 2017. It is an order of magnitude more sensitive than PTF and hence poised to uncover rarer events. Instead of a seven-square-degree camera, we have a 47-square-degree camera; instead of taking 40 seconds to read out the camera, it will take less than 15 seconds.,I am leading a couple of projects. The first is a project called SPIRITS, which stands for the SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey. We are looking for infrared transients. Although there are many surveys at optical wavelengths, the infrared is completely pristine. It's like going off fishing in new waters.,We use the Spitzer Space Telescope and a bunch of ground-based observatories to take images in the infrared of 242 nearby galaxies on different timescales. Most of what I'm finding so far seems to be mergers of individual massive stars and the births of binaries, which you can only see in the infrared because they form in a red cloud of gas and dust.,This is a Spitzer Exploration Science Program, which means we've been granted more than 1,300 hours of time on the space telescope to do this in a very big way over three years.,I'm also the principal investigator on the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen) project that was,by the National Science Foundation's Partnerships in International Research and Education program. Our network includes six U.S. universities and six foreign countries spanning the globe to observe transients before they fade away, beating sunrise.,In building this network, we went both for telescopes that would make sense for the network and for people who would enjoy this type of science. It is not for everyone. It's nerve-wracking—you're doing work at 2 a.m., 3 a.m., and if you drop the ball, it's a pretty big deal. We tried to pick coinvestigators who are sufficiently excited about the science so that when they wake up, they aren't in a grumpy mood.,There is a wonderful organization called Asha, which means hope, which runs schools for underprivileged children in India. To me education is the solution to many of the problems in India. I've been helping Asha with fundraising and setting up these schools. When I go back home, I try to visit the Asha schools.

My current research focus is on building robust and verifiable AI systems that can be trusted to behave reasonably even under adversarial circumstances (see,and,for a summary of my recent research).,More generally, I am interested in developing algorithms to guarantee correct behavior in complex autonomous systems. My PhD thesis focused on efficient algorithms for stochastic optimal control and reinforcement learning in risk-sensitive situations (see,and,). I also worked on applying ideas from robust and risk averse control to electric power grids with high penetrations of uncertain renewable generation sources like wind and solar energy (see,and,), before moving to DeepMind.,My research has received several best paper awards at AI conferences (,and,). My work at DeepMind has also been incorporated into,PhD in Computer Science and Engineering, 2014,University of Washington, Seattle,MS in Computer Science and Engineering, 2010,University of Washington, Seattle,B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering, 2008,IIT Bombay,for",/img/Dj.jpg,https://dvij.github.io
"(2006),Optical microcavities can be characterized by two key quantities: an effective mode volume Veff, which describes the per photon electric field strength within the cavity, and a quality factor Q, which describes the photon lifetime within the cavity. Cavities with a small Veff and a high Q offer the promise for applications in nonlinear optics, sensing, and cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity QED). Chip-based devices are particularly appealing, as planar fabrication technology can be used to make optical structures on a semiconductor chip that confine light to wavelength-scale dimensions, thereby creating strong enough electric fields that even a single photon can have an appreciable interaction with matter. When combined with the potential for integration and scalability inherent to microphotonic structures created by planar fabrication techniques, these devices have enormous potential for future generations of experiments in cavity QED and quantum networks.,This thesis is largely focused on the development of ultrasmall Veff, high-Q semiconductor optical microcavities. In particular, we present work that addresses two major topics of relevance when trying to observe coherent quantum interactions within these semiconductor-based systems: (1) the demonstration of low optical losses in a wavelength-scale microcavity, and (2) the development of an efficient optical channel through which the sub-micron-scale optical field in the microcavity can be accessed. The two microcavities of specific interest are planar photonic crystal defect resonators and microdisk resonators.,The first part of this thesis details the development of photonic crystal defect microcavities. A momentum space analysis is used to design structures in graded square and hexagonal lattice photonic crystals that not only sustain high Qs and small Veffs, but are also relatively robust to imperfections. These designs are then implemented in a number of experiments, starting with device fabrication in an InAsP/InGaAsP multi-quantum-well material to create low-threshold lasers with Qs of 1.3x10^4, and followed by fabrication in a silicon-on-insulator system to create passive resonators with Qs as high as 4.0x10^4. In the latter experiments, an optical fiber taper waveguide is used to couple light into and out of the cavities, and we demonstrate its utility as an optical probe that provides spectral and spatial information about the cavity modes. For a cavity mode with Q ~ 4x10^4, we demonstrate mode localization data consistent with Veff ~ 0.9(λ/n)^3.,In the second part of this thesis, we describe experiments in a GaAs/AlGaAs material containing self-assembled InAs quantum dots. Small diameter microdisk cavities are fabricated with Q ~ 3.6x10^5 and Veff ~ 6(λ/n)^3, and with Q ~ 1.2x10^5 and Veff ~ 2(λ/n)^3. These devices are used to create room-temperature, continuous-wave, optically pumped lasers with thresholds as low as 1μW of absorbed pump power. Optical fiber tapers are used to efficiently collect emitted light from the devices, and a laser differential efficiency as high as 16% is demonstrated. Furthermore, these microdisk cavities have the requisite combination of high Q and small Veff to enable strong coupling to a single InAs quantum dot, in that the achievable coupling rate between the quantum dot and a single photon in the cavity is predicted to exceed the decay rates within the system. Quantum master equation simulations of the expected behavior of such fiber-coupled devices are presented, and progress towards such cavity QED experiments is described.,Repository Staff Only:","/images/new_cls_logo_60.gif,/images/codalogo.jpg,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/1.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/00_KS_thesis_double_sided_printing_full.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/2.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/01_KS_thesis_single_sided_printing_full.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/3.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/02_KS_thesis_single_sided_front_matter.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/4.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/03_KS_thesis_single_sided_preface_and_list_of_pubs.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/5.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/04_KS_thesis_single_sided_part_I_intro.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/6.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/05_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter1.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/7.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/06_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter2.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/8.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/07_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter3.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/9.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/08_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter4.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/10.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/09_KS_thesis_single_sided_part_II_intro.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/11.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/10_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter5.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/12.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/11_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter6.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/13.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/12_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter7.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/14.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/13_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter8.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/15.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/14_KS_thesis_single_sided_chapter9.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/16.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/15_KS_thesis_single_sided_appendices.pdf,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/style/images/fileicons/application_pdf.png,https://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/17.haspreviewThumbnailVersion/16_KS_thesis_single_sided_bibliography.pdf,/images/eprintslogo.gif",http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/1816/

"“I did my first condensed matter physics experiment, and discovered how much I enjoyed the whole process—the hands-on aspect of preparing your own samples, collaborating across disciplines with materials scientists, and looking at the properties of new materials where you really don’t know what you’re going to find. All of that appealed to me.”,I’m studying graphene, a unique material made up of a single layer of carbon atoms. It conducts heat and electricity very well and is the thinnest and strongest material we know of, so it has many potential applications. It has many other bizarre and intriguing properties, and the scientists who were the first to prepare it in a single layer and describe some of its unusual characteristics won the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics. My experiments focus on how electrons move and interact in graphene, a phenomenon we don’t understand very well. We’d like to know whether their behavior is correlated—in other words, if you have electron movement over here, does it affect what electrons are doing over there, and how do the electrons influence each other across these distances? This is fundamental physics research, but gaining a deeper understanding of graphene’s electrical properties will also help us to envision and develop applications.,In high school I knew that I wanted to study physics, and in college I was originally attracted to astrophysics and quantum field theory—you know, you read popular science books and everyone wants to be Feynman! But soon after I started my master’s program at IISc I did my first condensed matter physics experiment, and discovered how much I enjoyed the whole process—the hands-on aspect of preparing your own samples, collaborating across disciplines with materials scientists, and looking at the properties of new materials where you really don’t know what you’re going to find. All of that appealed to me.,Back in Bangalore I was very active with a program called Notebook Drive that creates educational opportunities for underprivileged children. We teach in the primary schools and provide them with books, take students on science field trips, and organize other activities to encourage them to stay in school. After getting my PhD I spent several months working on a project jointly funded by the Indian government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a lab-on-a chip diagnostic device for use in rural India. Since coming to Caltech, I’ve been involved in Caltech OASIS (Organization of Associated Students of the Indian Subcontinent).
