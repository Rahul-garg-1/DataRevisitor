"Andru Gheorghiu,“I am a computer scientist working primarily at the intersection of quantum cryptography and quantum complexity theory. I am attracted to the connections between complexity theory and physics and the way that their questions have a philosophical component to them. I find it interesting that complexity theory can say something about physics and situations that might happen in physics and inform us in creating new theories of understanding nature.”,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar,Vidick Group,Email,Website,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,I am a computer scientist working primarily at the intersection of quantum cryptography and quantum complexity theory. I started working on blind-delegated quantum computing protocols that involve a client asking a quantum computer to solve a particular problem while keeping the algorithm secret from the computer. Part of my work is attempting to understand the kind of communication we would need to achieve this with a quantum computer and characterize what we could do with these types of protocols as well as how efficient they would be. I am also interested in the problem of verifying the correctness of quantum computations. Recently, protocols have been developed for both blind delegation and verification. I am currently trying to see whether these protocols can be made more efficient, in terms of the computational resources of the client, and I am also working to extend these protocols so that they may be composed with other protocols in a secure way.,My interest in complexity theory has led me to investigate more general questions pertaining to the potential applications that complexity theory might have in physics. Complexity theory is particularly interesting because it allows us to consider what we can and cannot solve efficiently using quantum computers, and it is the tool we use to answer questions pertaining to the hardness of problems under different models of computation. I have been looking at toy models of quantum gravity to try to argue that computing certain physical quantities, in these models, would be intractable even for quantum computers. So broadly speaking, I am just trying to see if we can use the tools of complexity theory to say something interesting about quantum gravity.,What drew you to this work?,I have always been interested in both physics and computer science. I attended a computer programming high school, and the reason I got interested in physics was because of Stephen Hawking’s,A Brief History of Time,. This book changed my outlook on the world by making me aware of the fact that the universe is governed by the laws of physics and that we can express these laws in the language of mathematics. This allows us to make predictions about the behavior of physical systems and ultimately gain a greater understanding of our world. I found this very impressive and appealing, and I appreciated both that everything is governed by these laws and that we can understand them. In essence, I was impressed by what Eugene Wigner called “the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences.”,When I was younger, I read a lot of popular science articles, and I stumbled across quantum computing. I thought this was the perfect thing for me because it combined both physics and computer science by harnessing the strange laws of quantum mechanics in order to solve interesting problems more efficiently than we could with classical computers. My interests evolved to studying quantum cryptography in graduate school because that was the research topic of my advisor.,I was interested in the history of computer science as well, and I’ve always been more attracted to theory than practical things. I was reading up on complexity theory, and I found it very interesting that it originated with famous mathematicians who were trying to answer questions that were almost philosophical in nature, such as whether the creative process involved in deriving mathematical proofs can be fully automated and made efficient. The question at the heart of complexity theory is whether for problems with solutions that can be checked efficiently, we can also find a solution efficiently. I found it very interesting that this question, known as the P vs NP problem, has far reaching implications in almost all areas of science. On top of that, the P vs NP problem is also highly relevant to modern cryptography, since most cryptographic protocols used today hide information by encoding it as solutions to computationally hard problems. More recently, researchers have used complexity theory to study paradoxes arising in physics, such as the black hole information paradox. Given my interest in both computer science and physics, I am especially attracted to these connections between the two fields. I find it interesting that complexity theory can say something about physics and situations that might happen in physics and thus inform us in creating new theories for understanding nature.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,I tend to read a lot of comic books, and am somewhat of a comic book geek.,The Dark Knight Returns,by Frank Miller is probably my favorite comic.  I also play chess, and if I have some time, I might go to the gym or play some sports.  But most of my time outside of my research is spent watching movies and TV shows. I partly got into science because I used to watch and read a lot of science fiction as a kid, and I still watch many TV shows and movies that are science fiction or space related.,Stargate,(all three series) is my favorite science fiction show.  I find space exploration and the Apollo program so interesting, and until recently,,Apollo 13,was my favorite movie.  That was, however, until I went to the cinema five times to watch,First Man,, which is now my favorite movie of all time. I absolutely loved it.  It is definitely one of my dreams to eventually go to space. I don’t know if that will ever happen, but I can still hope."

"Shenghan Jiang,“I became a theorist because I enjoy the curiosity that is inherent in investigating when something unexpected happens. As a condensed matter physicist, I am fascinated by both the mathematical beauty and the predictive power of physics. When you read books about physics, you are able to understand things by following the logic of the author, but when you are doing research, you need to discover your own way to understand things and even derive new physics. That’s one of the most interesting parts of research. One thing I enjoy about my work is interpreting things in new ways—in my own way.”,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Theoretical Physics,Xie Chen Group,Email,Website,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,I am a condensed matter theorist, and I work in strongly correlated systems. I am interested in the collective behavior of electrons. In some materials, electrons interact strongly, in which case the single electron picture may fail and what emerges is the collective mode of electrons. Exotic things such as fractionalization may happen. Examples include fractional quantum Hall systems, high temperature superconductors, et al. My focus is on studying models using both analytical and numerical methods to identify exotic behaviors in these strongly correlated models. Quantum materials are described by very complicated models, and we try to find simplified effective models, such as the Hubbard model and the t-J model, which we believe also capture the essential physics of many exotic behaviors of real materials such as high temperature superconductors.,Even though this type of model looks very simple, it is still very, very hard to solve. As a condensed matter physicist, I am fascinated by both the mathematical beauty and the predictive power of physics. I use analytical methods, such as field theory and exact solvable models to solve or guess solutions and to understand the physics behind the correlated models. By using numerical methods, I am trying to predict phases and phase transitions, and I am trying to see if there are exotic behaviors, such as fractionalizations in realistic models.,What drew you to this work?,I became a theorist because I enjoy the curiosity that is inherent in investigating when something unexpected happens…and because I am bad at experiments. My undergraduate studies were in electronics and communication engineering. I took a lot of physics classes, and I found them very interesting, and I decided to switch directions for my graduate work. I pursued a PhD in theoretical physics because it gives me the opportunity to work to understand things in my own way and because the field is really interesting. I just enjoy doing the work. One of the reasons that I work in strongly correlated systems is because the problems are very complicated. First, although we have some methods to “derive” the effective model by fitting experimental data, we don’t know if the Hamiltonian that we have describes this model. It is very, very hard in a strongly correlated system to determine a Hamiltonian for a specific model. Second, even if we know the Hamiltonian, it is still extremely difficult to solve the problem. You can either guess a solution by physical insight, or you should find a simplified model which could capture the essential physics and at the same time would be easier to solve. One of my motivations for doing research is to understand things in my own way. When you read books about physics, you are able to understand things by following the logic of the author. But when you are doing research, you need to discover your own way to understand things and even derive new physics. That’s one of the most interesting parts of research. One of my favorite parts of my work is interpreting things in new ways—in my own way.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,I have a four-month-old baby, and I love getting to spend my time outside of work with her and my wife. We spend many afternoons walking together in the Huntington Library where my wife is a visiting scholar. We enjoy hiking and traveling, and our favorite part of California is the Chinese food. I also enjoy jogging. This area is such a great environment for running, and I regularly run half marathon distances for fun."

"Nicholas (Nick) Laurita,“I exploit the interaction of light with matter to uncover the properties of so-called “quantum materials” – materials which display quantum mechanical properties on the macroscopic scale. Currently I am studying a class of materials known as quantum spin liquids which have been theorized to host effective particles which are not conventionally found in nature. It’s as if each crystal of these materials is its own mini-universe where the laws of physics have been rewritten!”,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar,Hsieh Group,Email,Website,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,In my research, I exploit the interaction of light with matter to uncover the properties of so-called “quantum materials” – materials which display quantum mechanical properties on the macroscopic scale. Most of the time, the true quantum-ness of nature is hidden from our everyday lives because we experience the world on a very different scale than that of sub-atomic particles, where quantum mechanics truly thrives. However, certain materials can be driven into unusual quantum phases by particularly strong interactions between the electrons of the material.  The goal of my research, which takes place in the Hsieh lab, is to uncover these quantum phases by studying how the material interacts with intense laser pulses. Usually this requires extreme experimental conditions, often occurring at temperatures near absolute zero, and uses ultra-fast high-intensity lasers, which emit as many as one-hundred thousand laser pulses per second, each of which only lasts less than 1 billionth of a second.,Currently I am studying a class of materials known as quantum spin liquids.  These materials are, in a sense, a very disordered version of the magnets that many people may be more familiar with, like those we use to attach notes to our refrigerators. However, despite the electrons of these materials possessing strong magnetic interactions, these materials never become truly magnetic, even if the temperature is decreased to absolute zero.  Instead, the electrons of these materials form an exotic magnetic “liquid” that undulates in truly special ways thanks to the laws of quantum mechanics. The results can be extraordinary, with many theories predicting that these materials may host effective particles which are not conventionally found in nature. It’s as if each crystal is its own mini-universe where the laws of physics have been rewritten! While research in this field is still in its infancy, the hope is that these new particles may one day be used as the basis of quantum computation.,What drew you to this work?,As an undergraduate, I was positive I wanted to study astrophysics. Like many people I was captivated by space. I wanted to look at stars, think about black holes, and study gravity. However, I was offered a research opportunity in a condensed matter laboratory early on as an undergraduate. I really didn’t know much about condensed matter at the time but I thought it at least would be a good opportunity to learn some new physics and gain experience in a lab. The lab I joined was working on magnetism at the time, and the more I learned about it, the more interested I became. Now I’ve been studying magnetism for over a decade, and in that time, research into quantum magnetism has really flourished. There are so many fantastic groups out there discovering new materials and characterizing them. It’s really a vibrant and active area of condensed matter research, and it is very fun to be a part of that research.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,Outside of lab, I spend much of my time outdoors.  California is an amazing place where you’re somehow simultaneously a fairly short drive away from the beach, the desert, and skiing. Plus it’s sunny almost year round.  My wife and I go hiking in the mountains near our house with our dog quite often. I also enjoy organized sports and play softball a few times a week around LA. If I’m home then I’m probably reading or writing. Last year I helped co-author a book on paradoxes in math and physics tentatively called,A Most Ingenious Paradox,, which was recently picked up by MIT press and will appear on bookshelves next year."

"Anand Natarajan,“I am interested in the connections between the rigorous math of quantum mechanics and computer science, and I enjoy thinking about the way that the deep ideas of physics and the deep ideas of computer science come together. When I was studying physics, I observed how brilliant physicists like Richard Feynman and John Preskill were proposing prescient ideas about quantum computing, and I was intrigued by the apparent possibilities in the field. Since I really enjoy math, I found that this intersection of the fields of theoretical computer science and physics was a great fit for me.”,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar,Vidick Group,Preskill Group,Email,Website,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,I am a theorist broadly considering the role that computational complexity has in entanglement. Foundational questions of how the Hilbert space should be defined were previously though to be purely mathematical details, but it seems that they might have different computational powers. This probably would have been surprising to people like von Neumann when they were writing down the axioms of quantum mechanics because they would not have thought that thinking about computer programs would have anything to do with this. The unexpected connection between quantum mechanics with all this deep math and then computer science is one thing that I find really cool about this area.,In computer science people care a lot about proof systems. One topic that I work on is multi-proofer entracted (MPE) proofs and how they are related to quantum computing. In these systems, two people or systems are spatially separated which raises some interesting questions. What does it mean to have two systems that are separated? And in what way does entanglement makes it possible for them to prove more computational problems, particularly problems that come from the quantum realm?,My current work is thinking of protocols in the MPE model for computational problems, and then proving that these protocols actually work so the provers cannot falsely prove something that is not true. I do a lot of math with pencil and paper to understand what sorts of things two parties sharing an entangled state can do. If they have measurements and you know something about the properties of their measurements, what can you deduce from that? It’s a lot of working with matrixes. The MPE is not really realistic, but classical research has ways to take results from this model and import them over to a more realistic use. In the quantum world, this is yet to be done, but that is something that I want to investigate over the course of my post doc.,What drew you to this research?,I grew up listening to pop science lectures about black holes and participating in the Physics Olympiad, and I was inspired by the ideas of physics. When I began studying physics in undergrad, I imagined that I would end up working in particle physics or string theory, but as I studied and took computer science classes for fun, I discovered that I enjoyed the way that the deep ideas of physics and the deep ideas of computer science come together. I observed how brilliant physicists like Feynman and John Preskell were proposing prescient ideas about quantum computing, and I was intrigued by the apparent possibilities in the field. While physics is dependent on experiments, in quantum information a lot of what we do is rigorous math. We can provide mathematically rigorous proofs of things, and that is a way to make progress without experiments. Since I really enjoy rigorous math, I found that this intersection of the fields of theoretical computer science and physics was a great fit for me.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,I enjoy learning new languages. I have learned Spanish and French, and as a child I learned both Sanskrit and Tamil. I credit my experiences in the Linguistic Olympiad in high school with fostering my love of language. In the Olympiad, we had to derive linguistic solutions based on foreign language information, and I enjoyed the intellectual puzzle. I also like listening to Indian classical music, and before my life as a researcher, I played the piano. Cooking is another hobby, and I am always looking for more vegetarian culinary possibilities."

"Alp Sipahigil,“I study nanoscale hybrid quantum systems involving qubits in engineered acoustic and photonic structures. I work with (old and new) solid-state qubits and explore ways to tailor their interaction with their phononic and electromagnetic environments and with other qubits. This work requires us to understand microscopic mechanisms that take place in nanoscale devices with great precision and allows us to explore new ways to process quantum information. As an experimentalist, I have fun playing with fancy toys and experimenting with new systems in previously inaccessible regimes.”,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar,Painter Group,Email,Website,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,I study the properties and applications of nanoscale hybrid quantum systems involving qubits in engineered acoustic and photonic structures. Most recently, I have been investigating the coherence properties and applications of sub-micron scale acoustic resonators. These resonators, developed in the Painter Group, can be very effectively isolated from their environment — they can oscillate about 10 billion times before losing their energy. We recently developed a transducer to couple such acoustic resonators to superconducting microwave circuits, and we are now using these transducers to get new insights into the decoherence mechanisms of nano-acoustic resonators. We are also looking for ways to utilize this system as a quantum memory for superconducting circuits and as a converter of single photons from microwave frequencies to the optical domain. Such a converter would allow us to create entanglement between superconducting microwave circuits over long distances via room-temperature fiber links without having to worry about thermal photons.,What drew you to this work?,When I started college, I was interested in music and played in a band, so I was interested in studying topics related to acoustics and signal processing as an electrical engineer. When I took a quantum physics class, I really enjoyed it and decided to switch to physics. Two of my favorite subjects in undergrad were information theory and quantum physics. Quantum information research, therefore, seemed like a fun, interdisciplinary combination of the two.,Oddly enough, I am back to working on acoustics, only now in an extreme regime at ultralow temperatures and using nanoscale devices.  Some concepts transfer, but there are many new properties that emerge at the nanometer scale.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,I typically have more free time when I’m in the design stage of a new experiment. I then go back to playing music more frequently (to a typical audience of zero to one person and a dog). I play the guitar, but I also tend to pick up new instruments every now and then.  I recently explored a Turkish instrument called the kopuz, but I am still quite bad at it. I have been trying to explore southern California and go on hikes whenever I can. On some weekends I spend a day at the Huntington to relax and to do some reading."
"Alexandre Cooper-Roy,“As an experimentalist, I enjoy building new experiments that probe unknown aspects of the physical world and validate yet unproven theories.  In experiments, we are sometimes able to see the truth beyond the reality of the world around us.  I find that studying atoms is like studying life.  It is interesting to think about how atoms have lives of their own—their own unique sets of interesting behavioral properties. My goal is to simplify, and when I see something new, I seek to explain it.”,Research Associate, Senior Technical Lead – IQC, Waterloo University,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Quantum Information and Quantum Dynamics, Alumnus 2019,Endres Group,Email,Website,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,In my work, I engineer quantum systems to process quantum information and create a bridge of knowledge between quantum information and condensed matter physics with the tools and systems of atomic physics.  In our lab, we are building a new experiment to create a chain of single atoms that will help us see the interesting physics that emerge when these atoms interact.  We want to better understand the properties of interacting quantum systems and then engineer these systems to simulate condensed matter systems.,My current work is building an optical system to create optical tweezers that will allow us to trap single atoms using a focused laser beam of light to exert a force on an atom.  Our current goal is to cool, trap, and image single strontium atoms arranged in a chain with a linear array of optical tweezers. Ideally, we would create a chain without defect, but that is not always what happens because of imperfect loading efficiency.  Using new feedback control algorithms, we will use a camera to identify the defects in the chain, and using the optical tweezers, we plan to reposition the atoms and create a perfect chain without defect.  Previously atomic work has been done with rubidium and its single electron, but the two electrons of a strontium atom will allow us to investigate how the rich physics in this more complicated two electron system functions.,What drew you to this work?,It was the metaphysical questions that drew me to physics.   While I was always interested in the applications of physics, I am also intrigued by the fundamental questions.  During my PhD at MIT, I began working more specifically with single quantum systems in solid-state devices.  There is really interesting physics in small ensembles of interacting quantum systems, but it is difficult to scale these systems up and control large ensembles with single particle resolution.  Consequently I became interested in ultracold gases, because in these more complex systems, there is a lot of physics to be understood.  I am interested in understanding the problem of the emergent properties of increasingly large quantum systems and better understanding the physics principles that may elucidate the quantum-to-classical transition.  I find that the intersection of the theory and the application is a great place to look for the answers to fundamental questions.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,I enjoy running, and when I’m not at the lab, I also do laundry and buy groceries.  I like to work out and read, but mostly, I think.  I think that thinking is a big deal.  When we do physics, there are a lot of questions and problems to think about, and it is important to leave space for contemplating these questions.  Thinking takes a lot of energy, so I also make sure to have time to mentally disconnect.  I try to minimize what I do, because I feel that when I can eliminate what is not essential, I have time to think and consider the larger questions that drew me to my work."
"Yuval Baum,“Physics has always fascinated me.  Even when I was young, I wanted to understand how things happen, and in theoretical physics, I have an opportunity to ask questions that help us understand more about the way the world works.  I also like mathematics.  It is always beautiful to see abstract mathematical tools somehow conspire with nature and to see that there are mathematical frameworks that can completely explain and help us understand the world around us.”,Quantum Control Engineer at Q-CTRL,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Topological Quantum Physics and Quantum Dynamics, Alumnus 2020,Refael Group,Email,Website,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,I am interested in theoretical physics and electronic systems.  The main goal in my work is to find out whether or not we can get something from our ideas that we cannot get in other ways.,Right now I am working on two main topics.  The first is memory effects in quantum mechanics.  We know how particles accelerate based on force, but we do not know if they can remember their past.  I am looking to see if there is any memory of previous interactions with other electrons or the environment and if the dynamics are affected by memory.  I take quantum mechanics questions that we know how to solve, and I add in memory to see if we get an effect.  If quantum systems have memory, perhaps we can prevent decoherence of the quantum properties even as the environment interacts with the system.  Perhaps quantum systems remember what it is to be quantum.,I also investigate topological effects on electronic properties.  While we know a lot about how topological effects affect the properties of electrons in metals, more knowledge will give us insight into phenomena that we do not understand.  My work focuses on taking the concept to the extreme and trying to control the topological effects.  I am interested in whether we can control the topological properties of electrons by changing the crystal properties.,What drew you to this work?,Physics has always fascinated me.  Even when I was young, I wanted to understand how things happen, and in theoretical physics, I have an opportunity to ask questions that help us understand more about the way the world works.  I also like mathematics.  It is always beautiful to see abstract mathematical tools somehow conspire with nature and to see that there are mathematical frameworks that can completely explain and help us understand the world around us.,I decided to work in theory because you have the freedom to think about things and ask questions that may reach beyond the scope of the current interests of the field.  I like that you can think about something, why particular things happen, and then through questioning, you might be able to explain something new.  I have been studying topological effects for quite some time, and one of the fun things about this work is that while it’s very interesting, the problems are also quite accessible and the questions can be answered.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,Hiking and traveling are by far my favorite things to do.  Since coming to Los Angeles, I have had the opportunity to travel around much of the West, and there are so many things to see.  My wife and I try to hike whenever we can, and we also enjoy playing tennis.  Every year we try to do a big trip, and so far we have seen some amazing things like the northern lights in Lapland, the Himalayas, and quite a bit of Europe.  While we are in Los Angeles we are really looking forward to having the opportunity to explore more of the U.S. as well.,I also enjoy cooking.  It’s great to get to try new things, and often we cook up something and then invite people over on the weekends."
"Yoni BenTov,“I am currently trying to understand the statistical mechanics underlying the thermodynamics of Kerr black holes. Hawking’s famous calculation from 1975 suggested that black hole evaporation turns pure states into mixed states, violating a bedrock principle of quantum mechanics. The AMPS paradox of 2013 sharpened the problem, and the most straightforward interpretation is that the equivalence principle of general relativity must break down near the horizon of an arbitrarily large black hole. This is a regime of arbitrarily small curvature, where we normally expect effective quantum field theory on a semiclassical geometry to be perfectly well behaved. I am trying to understand why this picture breaks down and what can be done to remedy it.”,Postdoctoral Scholar, Perimeter Institute,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus – Topological Quantum Physics and Quantum Dynamics,Kitaev Group,PhD, 2013,University of California, Santa Barbara,Email,Website,Interview,What is your current research?,I am currently trying to understand the statistical mechanics underlying the thermodynamics of Kerr black holes.

We know much from string theory about the statistical mechanics behind extremal black holes, and Kitaev recently invented the first exactly solvable model of AdS/CFT, which can be construed as a theory of statistical mechanics for gravity in AdS2. I am trying to learn what I can about Kerr black holes away from extremality, because it is those black holes that are the most common gravitational thermodynamic equilibrium states in nature. This work involves general relativity, astrophysics, statistical mechanics, quantum chaos, and quantum field theory. What’s not to like?,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,Lately my hobbies are drawing, playing guitar, practicing yoga, and learning constitutional law."
"Johannes Fink,“I first got interested in the quantum world in high school, when I read about phenomena like entanglement and action at a distance and experiments in quantum teleportation. I was intrigued by the philosophical aspects—for instance, what quantum theory says about the nature of reality—and I was also interested in the technical details of the research. Now I’m working in a field that combines all those interests.”,Assistant Professor, IST Austria,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Quantum Information,Painter Group,PhD, 2010, ETH, Zurich,Interview,What is your current research?,I’m an applied physicist, working on the design, fabrication, and testing of microchips that contain both electrical and mechanical circuits—what we call resonant circuits. These structures are typically very small, and the electrical circuits are made of superconducting material. We want to cool these devices as close as possible to absolute zero, to the point where there is so little energy left that we’re essentially dealing with a single quantum of microwave or mechanical energy whose properties we can control and manipulate. One of our main goals with these chips is to study entanglement—this is where you have distinct systems whose behavior can only be described collectively, no matter how far apart they are separated in space. Ultimately we would like to entangle the microwave elements with the mechanics and the mechanics with optics, a very challenging goal that requires a lot of different techniques and technologies.,What appeals to you about this research?,I first got interested in the quantum world in high school, when I read about phenomena like entanglement and action at a distance and experiments in quantum teleportation. I was intrigued by the philosophical aspects—for instance, what quantum theory says about the nature of reality—and I was also interested in the technical details of the research. Now I’m working in a field that combines all those interests. A hundred years ago the first quantum theorists had lengthy debates about the validity of quantum mechanics and its relationship to the classical world, and now we can actually go into the lab and study those questions. It’s exciting to do experiments where you can see entanglement and observe quantum effects in larger and larger systems, and do complex engineering to explore and understand this quantum world. I also like the fact that as an experimentalist I’m involved in all the details. I know how to make and design the microchip, how to do the experiment and how to model and interpret the acquired data.  So there is a lot of change and variety in what you do, and I think that is very rewarding.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,I like backpacking, and I travel a lot—I spent some time in South America after I finished my PhD. I grew up in Austria and went to graduate school in Switzerland so I like activities related to the mountains—hiking, snowboarding, and skiing. Since coming to Southern California, my wife and I have been spending time at the local beaches. We enjoy that, but in general the work is quite intense here, so I don’t have a great deal of time for it."
"Elizabeth Crosson,“I’ve always had very diverse interests in the natural sciences, and at first it was hard for me to devote myself to just one field of research. I’m really lucky that the opportunity to do quantum computing fell into my lap, because I really like the way it combines modern physics, pure mathematics, and theoretical computer science. In this field I get to use the kind of rigorous methods and proofs that computer scientists emphasize, as well as the intuition we can build from physical understanding and applications to the real world.”,Associate Professor of Physics, University of New Mexico,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumna in Quantum Information,Preskill Group,PhD, 2015,University of Washington,Email,Website,Interview,What is your current research?,I work on quantum systems that are on the border between the classical and quantum worlds. These systems have many familiar quantum characteristics—like superposition and entanglement—but they also have a feature that makes them seem somewhat classical. In equilibrium, they don’t have complex phases that cause interference, and that inspires us to try and simulate these systems using classical computers.  I’m trying to find out exactly where this quantum/classical border is, what’s possible to do on a normal computer, and what we need a quantum computer to do.,One of the phenomena I work on is quantum annealing, meaning the use of quantum computers to solve an optimization problem and minimize the cost or resources that go into a given task. I build and run simulations, both to try and understand what the quantum annealing optimizers will do for us once they’re available, and also to try and see how far these classical simulations can be pushed. Since we have yet to build large quantum computers, it’s very important to simulate them to predict what they will be able to do, and we’re hoping to find ways that quantum algorithms will be even better than classical ones at these kinds of optimization problems.,What drew you to this work?,I was bitten by the scientific curiosity bug at an early age. It started with astronomy—contemplating the vastness of the universe instilled me with a sense of awe for nature—and also reading about atoms and the incredible and mysterious world that exists at the smallest distance scales. The desire to understand modern scientific theories motivated me to study math, both for its intrinsic beauty and as a gateway to a career in physics that would allow me to spend my life thinking about these wonderful topics. I’ve always had very diverse interests in the natural sciences, and at first it was hard for me to devote myself to just one field of research. I’m really lucky that the opportunity to do quantum computing fell into my lap, because I really like the way it combines modern physics, pure mathematics, and theoretical computer science. In this field I get to use the kind of rigorous methods and proofs that computer scientists emphasize, as well as the intuition we can build from physical understanding and applications to the real world.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,My favorite thing to do outside of the office is read, especially non-fiction. Reading non-fiction might seem like just more work, but I don’t see it that way. There is so much to learn and be curious about. As an undergraduate I dabbled in courses on epistemology and the philosophy of science, which eventually lead me to get a major in philosophy on the side. Another of my favorite subjects is history, especially the creative achievements of great scientists, artists, and writers that advanced us into the modern civilization we now enjoy. Reading about past scientific revolutions—from Copernicus, to Newton, to Einstein—also gives us a perspective on where we are today with the revolutions brought about by quantum mechanics and even more recently by digital computers."

Basically, I’m working on making atoms talk to each other by placing them near nanophotonic structure —super tiny waveguides or photonic crystals—that enhance the interaction between them.”,Faculty, Columbia University,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumna,Kimble Group,PhD, 2014,Complutense University, Madrid,Email,Website,Interview,What is your current research?,I’m a theorist working in quantum optics and nanophotonics, and I collaborate with a group of experimentalists to propose new experiments and build models to understand their measurements. Basically, I’m working on making atoms talk to each other by placing them near nanophotonic structure —super tiny waveguides or photonic crystals—that enhance the interaction between them. Compared to how these atoms would behave in vacuum, they interact in a much stronger manner, so you can get really exotic effects. This research has many potential applications, such as in quantum nonlinear optics, and it could have a huge impact on how we transfer and store information, but it’s also just really fun. We put our heads together and draw on many different fields, because you have to deeply understand what’s going on to be able to grasp what the experiments are telling us.,What drew you to this work?,One of the things that I like about my current research is how many different fields it involves. You have to really understand the optics, what the electromagnetic fields are doing, and you have to understand the atomic physics as well. You can also bring in concepts from condensed matter theory and quantum information science. It’s like a communion of many different things, and I feel like I’m learning a lot along the way.,I’ve always been drawn to science because it answers questions in a very powerful way. My first instinct was to go into biology, but then I discovered the predictive power of physics and the beauty that math can add to the description of nature, and so that’s where my studies took me. There’s a very creative aspect to physics, and I really value that. I also enjoy the process of discovery and learning. When you first start a project, you don’t necessarily know what’s going on, and then after some months of work you realize that you do sort of understand it, and you’re able to connect this problem with many other problems that you’ve worked on, and this gives you a global perspective. This moment of enlightenment is my favorite part. I’m sure everyone will say that it’s the applications that are important, because they’ll save the world someday, but I just do it because I like it.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,Having just moved to Los Angeles, I am especially excited to check out the art scene, and visit the museums around here. I would like to learn how to surf, since it’s something that I’ve always wanted to try and it seems California would be a good place to get started. I really enjoy rollerblading. For a while, I commuted to campus that way, but the sidewalks can be a little treacherous, so now I mostly use my bike. I also like to read, and I spend time at home with my cats and my husband. I have been a volunteer at animal shelters in the past, and that’s something I may pursue here as well."

The systems that I typically study are quantum many-body systems—consisting of many particles or degrees of freedom—and I try to understand their properties using simple models that aim to capture the interactions between different particles.”,Microsoft Research,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus,Xie Chen Group,PhD, 2015,University of California, Berkeley,Email,Website,Interview,What is your current research?,I work at the intersection of quantum information and condensed matter, and my research interests span a wide range. The systems that I typically study are quantum many-body systems—consisting of many particles or degrees of freedom—and I try to understand their properties using simple models that aim to capture the interactions between different particles. For a pure theorist like me, the simplest case is just spin systems; for instance, in a one-dimensional system, you would have just a series of spins in a line. We also consider other systems, such as bosonic systems or fermionic systems, which are made up of fundamental particles. In many cases, I use ideas from quantum information theory at different levels, sometimes taking a particular concept that is useful in quantum information, like entanglement, and other times,importing insights from quantum information theorists.,I also use a range of different methodologies, sometimes relying on very rigorous proofs, and other times use heuristic arguments or numerical methods.,What drew you to this work?,My work is purely theoretical, and I have always been interested in that side of things, ever since I was very young. I don’t know that I had a very specific reason for choosing quantum information or condensed matter at the beginning, but after I came into the field, I have discovered a great many remarkable and beautiful works, and I really appreciate the progress made by those researchers who have opened up the field. Because my research areas are in some sense very diverse, I also find it exciting to work in a place like IQIM, where it’s easy to find collaborators on different projects and topics. My interests go very well with the name of the institute, since I work on both quantum information and condensed matter, so it’s a good fit for me.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,Usually after work, I like to relax at home and read, especially history. I’m from China originally, and Chinese history fascinates me. When I’m not reading, I also enjoy watching sports and shows on TV."
"Chen-Lung Hung,“I find it very exciting to think that we might be able to take the networks of atoms and photons we’re currently developing and use them to investigate processes like the quantum behavior of electrons in crystals.”,Assistant Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Purdue University,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus, Jan 2015,Kimble Group,View my Videos,Email,Contact,Interview,What is the type of research you’re doing?,Another way to think about this is that we are building a potential architecture for a quantum network. We want to build an infrastructure in which the photons propagating through our nanophotonic devices transfer information to atoms that act as memory units. Photons are very good at transmitting quantum information, and atoms are good at receiving and storing it. We are trying to create an interface that couples them strongly to one another so that there is as little information loss as possible.,How did you get into physics and into this line of work?,My interest in this research goes back to a famous talk Richard Feynman gave in 1981 called “Simulating Physics with Computers.” He said that if physicists ever hoped to truly understand and explore quantum mechanics they would need to build computational systems based on quantum mechanical principles and use them to simulate aspects of the quantum world. Ideally you want to set up a system that obeys certain quantum mechanical rules, allow it to evolve by itself, and then map its behavior to other quantum systems governed by the same type of rules. I find it very exciting to think that we might be able to take the networks of atoms and photons we’re currently developing and use them to investigate processes like the quantumbehavior of electrons in crystals. We don’t currently have the ability to deeply probe complex systems in this way, but we can begin to catch a sense of the physics behind them and use that to gradually build up our understanding of quantum mechanics in the world from bottom to top. It is this kind of potential that that really attracts me.,What attracted me to physics?  My parents are teachers in Taiwan, where I grew up, and we always had magazines like,Popular Science,around the house. I would read articles about general relativity, quantum mechanics, and other phenomena that seemed mysterious and fascinating, and that’s how I got interested.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,I like and used to play a lot of competitive team sports—basketball, baseball, and soccer—but as I’ve become busier, the frequency has dropped.  I like music and learned to play the violin when I was young. In our IQIM promotional video, I somehow appear playing the violin, but nowadays the soundproofing where I live is not so good and I play less by popular demand."
"Torsten Karzig,“I like extracting simplicity from complexity. I find it fascinating to probe seemingly strange and unusual quantum systems to see if I can understand them in simple terms.”,Lead Researcher, Microsoft Research, Station Q,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus, Sept 2015,Alicea,and,Refael,Groups,Interview,What are you currently working on?,A general theme of my research is investigating and modeling exotic quantum systems. Currently I’m looking at a class of particles called Majorana fermions, which we believe emerge under certain conditions in materials like semiconductors. One interesting thing about them is that they are actually their own antiparticles. Another is that moving a system of Majorana fermions slowly around each other and back to their original positions changes the quantum state of that system in a well-defined way regardless of the way you move the particles. In a quantum computing context, this would correspond to processing information in a protected way, so in theory a quantum computer utilizing Majorana fermions might be effectively shielded against all kinds of disturbances. I’m trying to develop a better understanding of how this might work in practice. One of the main things we’ve found is that there’s a kind of “speed limit” for moving these fermions, and if you exceed it, the system collapses and any information that’s been encoded is lost.  In fact the best way to protect the Majorana fermions is to move them infinitely slowly around each other, which of course is impossible. So the question is, how can we use them to develop a potentially workable quantum computing model.,What excites you about this work?,I like extracting simplicity from complexity. I find it fascinating to probe seemingly strange and unusual quantum systems to see if I can understand them in simple terms. My usual approach is to set up what’s called a minimum model—one that tries to capture all the system’s crucial elements while being simple enough to let you really understand what is going on and possibly use that understanding to develop new systems.  As a theorist you’re always looking for first principles that can be applied to all kinds of systems. You want to have a universal description of whatever phenomenon you’re investigating because that’s how a theory can have the most impact.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,One of my hobbies is playing Ultimate Frisbee, which is an amazing sport when you need to clear your mind.  I’m also involved in editing and creating the OpenStreetMap. It’s a kind of Wikipedia for maps that provides free, detailed maps of the world that can be downloaded to your GPS or mobile phone. In November 2013 the Red Cross used it to help route aid to stricken areas of the Philippines after the typhoon there, and they also used it after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. I find it exciting that you can be in your home or at your desk, looking at satellite imagery, and helping to develop maps that can have this kind of humanitarian impact."
"Olivier Landon-Cardinal,“Quantum information is a genuinely multidisciplinary area of science. I like that it’s a young field and that people come to it from diverse scientific backgrounds. One of the reasons I came to IQIM was because I wanted to be exposed to ideas from many different fields, and I have had that opportunity here.”,Postdoctoral Associate, McGill University,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus in Theoretical Physics,Preskill Group,PhD, 2013,Postdoctoral Associate, McGill University,Email,Contact,Interview,What can you tell us about your research?,Basically I’m trying to define a system to build a quantum hard-drive for a quantum computer. This would be a system of atomic particles that would preserve quantum information for a long period of time. Ideally it would encode information in such a way that it can be safely stored and easily retrieved. Think about a file on your conventional laptop: You create it, save it, and when you come back a few days later, all the information is still there. That’s what we’re after, but there are huge challenges. The most critical one is figuring out how to protect a quantum hard drive from environmental disturbances—what we call decoherence and which can instantly destroy its “quantumness”—while maintaining its thermal stability, i.e., its ability to withstand energy fluctuations that could wipe out the encoded information. We really don’t know how to accomplish that yet but we are steadily improving our understanding of what approaches do not work!,My research involves modeling and simulating various possibilities in two, three, and four dimensions and trying to determine which ones have actual potential.,What appeals to you about this work?,Quantum information is a genuinely multidisciplinary area of science. I like that it’s a young field and that people come to it from diverse scientific backgrounds. My training is diversified, yet centered on mathematical and theoretical physics, and it’s great to be able to interact and collaborate with people working in areas like quantum optics, condensed matter physics, computer science, and information science. Coming from a physics background means that when I’m talking to a colleague in, say, computer science, we both need to think and learn about how to adjust our language to communicate effectively. Once you’re capable of doing that, you have many interesting and fresh approaches that you can use to tackle common problems. That has a lot of appeal for me.  One of the reasons I came to IQIM was because I wanted to be exposed to ideas from many different fields, and I have had that opportunity here.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,I’m a big outdoors enthusiast. I like rock climbing, and I’ve been able to do a lot of it since I arrived in California. I also enjoy hiking and skiing, and I read a lot, especially classics and science fiction. I’m trilingual—my native tongue is French and I picked up English while growing up in Quebec, and learned Spanish at school. I left Montreal at the age of eighteen to study in France for several years before coming back for graduate studies. I enjoy traveling, music, and arts in general. I also practice yoga a lot, to relax and clear my mind."
"Stacey Jeffery,“I try to figure out what types of problems we can do faster with a quantum computer than we can with a classical computer, what those algorithms look like, and how we can do those computations securely. There are some kinds of classical algorithms that can always be sped up with a quantum computer. For example, if you want to find a mathematical object that has a particular property, you might start to look at a whole bunch of objects and test each one for the property you want.”,Scientific Staff Member at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, Amsterdam,Alumna, IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Theoretical Physics,Preskill,Schulman,, and,Vidick,Groups,PhD, 2014,University of Waterloo,Email,Contact,Interview,What is your current research?,I work on quantum algorithms and quantum cryptography, two broad applications of quantum computing. I try to figure out what types of problems we can do faster with a quantum computer than we can with a classical computer, what those algorithms look like, and how we can do those computations securely. There are some kinds of classical algorithms that can always be sped up with a quantum computer. For example, if you want to find a mathematical object that has a particular property, you might start to look at a whole bunch of objects and test each one for the property you want. That search process of continually sampling will be much faster on a quantum computer than on a classical one, so any time you have a classical algorithm that relies on that technique, you know right away that the quantum version will be an improvement. In other cases, there is no classical analog to a quantum algorithm, but instead we look at the techniques we have available to us and try to imagine what other problems they might be able to help us solve. By proving that a new algorithm would find the answer to a given question in a certain number of steps — hopefully a smaller number than it would take on a classical computer — we hope to optimize these quantum processes, which will be useful for all kinds of future applications in quantum computing.,What drew you to this work?,I took a class as an undergraduate computer science major and was so intrigued by the subject that I became a research assistant for the professor.  He was really interested in quantum algorithms and cryptography, and that’s how I got started in the field.  I am really drawn to the elegance of the mathematics, and I like working on something that has so much potential to be useful.  Coming to Caltech now as a postdoc has been a very eye-opening experience because I come from a computer science background, and there are so many people working on various aspects of the physics here at the IQIM.  It’s much more on the implementation side than what I’ve been exposed to so far, and being part of this group seems like a really good way to expand into other areas.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,I really enjoy listening to and making music, and singing is a big hobby of mine. I am also continually impressed by the weather here, and having moved from Ontario, Canada, last year, I really appreciate these consistently gorgeous days and try to take full advantage of them."

Right now, our group is launching an experimental effort to explore some quantum information using qubits, which are two-state systems—the quantum version of a classical bit. We want to use superconducting qubits, together with microwave waveguides and cavities, for both analog quantum simulation and quantum computation. In an analog quantum simulation, you couple some elements together in such a way that you emulate another quantum system or model, simply by virtue of what the elements are and how you’ve connected things.,Analog quantum simulations can yield new insights, but a world of possibilities opens up with quantum computation. We are developing our fabrication, software, and instrumentation to study new ideas in quantum error detection and correction, some of which are being developed right here at Caltech. For us, analog quantum simulation will be an important stepping stone on the way to performing quantum computations, as we will be able to benchmark our capabilities and gain experience. In doing so I hope to make some connections to the condensed matter research I was doing in graduate school, and interface with theorists here in the IQIM and elsewhere.,What drew you to this work?,I’ve wanted to become a physicist since I took advanced physics classes at my high school, the Illinois Math and Science Academy. As far as this project is concerned, I became interested because I was impressed with how superconducting qubits can be used as a platform for many experiments with very different aims, even with a modest number of qubits. There have been numerous proposals that consider coupled qubits using models borrowed from condensed matter physics, as well as models from quantum optics. Much like my graduate work, there is a lot of physics one can study with just one good device! Of course, it’s important for us as experimentalists to push on the limitations of our devices in order to make progress and be comfortable in drawing conclusions if and when we outpace theory.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,I got married and moved here last summer, so we’ve had half a year to settle into life in Los Angeles. It’s a great place for dining and trying different cuisine. The LA Philharmonic has some great concerts too and is easy to get to from Pasadena. We’ve been trying to hike whenever we get a chance, usually up by Pacific Palisades but sometimes farther out of LA."

"Mingwu Lu,“After my Ph.D. work (which was on the many-body simulation based on quantum gases of dysprosium via long ranged magnetic dipolar interactions), my research here has been a natural extension for me. At the same time, the entanglement between photon states and atomic states, in terms of both internal and external degrees of freedom simultaneously, may lead to rich and little-understood physics. In summary, it is an exciting and promising platform to develop and I’m happy to be a part of it. “,NIST, Laser Cooling and Trapping Group,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus,Kimble Group,PhD, 2014,Stanford,Email,Contact,Interview,What is your current research?,I am working on building a nano-scopic interface that enables strong interactions between light and matter. For many years, researchers have hoped to generate, store, transport, and manipulate information in a quantum way, which opens up many possibilities in fundamental research and applications. One common scheme, among others, proposes that information is stored in neutral atoms coded by internal quantum states and is exchanged quickly and coherently via flying photons. In our lab, we bring cesium atoms very close (100 nm) to the nano-scale photonic crystal waveguides in a controlled way, under vacuum. Trapping the atoms there is challenging because at this tiny distance, atoms are attracted to the solid devices due to the van der Waals force. Nevertheless, this system has several exciting features. The strong confinement of the evanescent light field near the waveguide boosts the coupling strength between those atoms and photons, and the band structure engineering of the waveguide brings additional controls on the strength and nature of the interactions, such as the slow light effect and quenched guided light modes in band gap. We hope to achieve strong couplings between single atoms and single photons, and considerable fundamental work has been done in in Prof. H. J. Kimble’s quantum optics lab, in collaboration with Prof. O. Painter’s lab at Caltech.,What appeals to you about this research?,This project has potential applications in quantum optics, quantum information, quantum computation, and quantum simulation in a fundamental research sense. In principle, atoms and light strongly coupled in nano-fabricated devices could be used to build a large quantity of identical quantum nodes in a quantum network, like transistors in integrated circuits. In other words, it’s scalable. Also in the strong coupling regime, trapped atoms interact with each other via fast and coherent exchange of photons. As a result, the effective forces between them can be very long-ranged because photons can travel long distances. This effect presents an opportunity to observe, for example, the phenomenon of self-organization, in the context of simulating many-body quantum physics. After my Ph.D. work (which was on the many-body simulation based on quantum gases of dysprosium via long ranged magnetic dipolar interactions), my research here has been a natural extension for me. At the same time, the entanglement between photon states and atomic states, in terms of both internal and external degrees of freedom simultaneously, may lead to rich and little-understood physics. In summary, it is an exciting and promising platform to develop and I’m happy to be a part of it.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,Outside the lab, I have a few hobbies.  During weekends, I go hiking sometimes up in the local mountains, which are convenient to get to.  I like to read, especially about science (not necessarily physics) and other non-fiction, like history.  I’m also a great admirer of classical music, particularly J.S. Bach."
"Mike Martin,“Another thing that appeals to me about this work is that nobody else is doing precisely what we’re currently doing at Caltech. We’re working in a quantum optics group with an amazing history and collaborating with one of the best nanofabrication groups in the world on these projects. It’s exciting.”,Researcher, Sandia National Laboratories,Alumnus, IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Physics,Kimble Group,PhD, 2013, University of Colorado,Email,Contact,Interview,What is your current research?,We work with cold atoms and nanophotonic devices, which are tiny structures that carry and guide light. We want to marry these technologies and use them to study how modifying the properties of light in the devices changes the way that light particles, or photons, interact with arrays of cold atoms. One reason we do this is to develop groundbreaking tools for quantum optics.,We take two types of measurements with these systems. We measure the optical properties of the nanophotonic devices, and those results feed back into our fabrication process so that we can make improvements to the devices.  Our other type of measurement involves putting atoms near these devices and analyzing the light signatures to determine how well the atoms are interacting with the photons. We build interference patterns into these structures so that light moves through them more slowly than it normally would, and that’s one way we’re able to strengthen its interaction with the chilled atoms,.,The more strongly we can couple the atoms to the photons, the more useful these systems become as tools for quantum optics and quantum information.,How did you get into physics and this line of work?,Physics was the first truly intellectually rigorous subject I studied, and that immediately drew me to it. Just by knowing Newtonian mechanics you can already predict and explain so much about the world around you. I liked having that potential for deep understanding. It’s empowering and very satisfying.,My entry into this quantum world started with what’s termed frequency metrology, otherwise known as time keeping. Part of my PhD work involved research aimed at making the world’s most precise atomic clock, and my colleagues have recently reported producing the best clock by any sort of metric. If you’re an atomic clockmaker, interacting atoms are bad because the ideal clock is an isolated atom sitting by itself at absolute zero, completely cut off from the rest of the world. I was trying to get a better understanding of how atomic interactions would disrupt the clock, and that kind of led me into this area. The types of atoms that we were working with also have great potential for simulating novel types of exotic systems that don’t really have any analogs in nature.,Another thing that appeals to me about this work is that nobody else is doing precisely what we’re currently doing at Caltech.

"Fernando Pastawski,“I’m interested in exploring how the classical world, which we perceive in our daily lives, emerges from the quantum world, and how we can interpret that relationship and deepen our understanding of it, because that’s what we want for quantum information.”,Freie Universität, Berlin,Alumnus, IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Theoretical Physics,Preskill Group,PhD, 2012,Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich,Interview,What is your current research?,I do theoretical research on how to preserve and strengthen quantum memories, which is essential for carrying out quantum-information processing and for developing a successful quantum computer. Quantum memories can be encoded in a single particle, such as an atom or photon, but most of my work explores how to store and protect them in many-body, or multi-particle, systems. The models I’m currently looking at correspond to having an array of many quantum bits, or “qubits,” which is what you need to build a quantum network capable of performing complicated computations. What interests me most right now, both fundamentally and from a quantum-computing standpoint, is this question of whether we can protect a such quantum system from decoherence—that is, from collapsing into a non-quantum state. How can we do this in a physically reasonable way?,You can achieve it in four dimensions—but you can’t build a four-dimensional system, so what are our options, realistically?,What appeals to you about this work?,I’ve always been interested in mathematical problem solving—I participated in math Olympiads in high school—but in college I decided that I wanted to do something more applied and relevant to the real world. So I went into theoretical computer science and also into physics. Quantum information, which was my focus in graduate school, seemed like a good marriage between the two fields, with lots of interesting theoretical questions. More generally, I’m interested in exploring how the classical world, which we perceive in our daily lives, emerges from the quantum world, and how we can interpret that relationship and deepen our understanding of it, because that’s what we want for quantum information.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,I like rock climbing, cooking, hiking, and traveling, and I enjoy surfing at Southern California beaches.

"David Mross,“This is mostly fundamental research, but in many cases there are connections to exciting applications which are being explored at IQIM. It’s a nice place to be to keep track of everything that’s going on outside my own research, and the atmosphere on campus is amazing.”,Assistant Professor, Weizmann Institute,Alumnus, IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Condensed Matter Theory,Alicea Group,PhD, 2013,MIT,Email,Contact,Interview,What is your current research?,I study various quantum phases and phase transitions in electronic systems. Just like the different phases of familiar materials — solid, liquid, gas, etc. — there can be different arrangements of electrons in quantum systems that lead to phases with a wide range of different properties. My research falls into the field of condensed matter physics, which studies collective behavior of many-particle systems, usually at low temperatures. In many of these systems, electrons cannot move freely, like atoms in a gas, but are subject to severe constraints, for example from Coulomb repulsion. To accommodate strong interactions, the electrons must act collectively and may form phases of matter very different from familiar metals or insulators. Additional constraints on the motion of electrons are imposed by symmetries such as the ones set by the structure of the underlying crystal. Satisfying the demands of both symmetry and interaction requires the electrons ‘to be creative’ which may result in truly exotic properties, such as systems where electrons get stripped of their charge but otherwise maintain their integrity. Lately, a lot of research — much of it at Caltech — has focused on systems with a third kind of constraint on the motion of electrons: topology. Since coming to IQIM, I have studied systems that mix all three of these ingredients together. You can get an abundance of fascinating things that you would never really have thought of before.,What drew you to this work?,What really pulled me into this field — and is keeping me here — is the emergence of complex behavior from just a small number of ingredients. I just love that you can have what looks like such a simple system — a crystal with electrons — and it seems like nothing much can happen, right? But it turns out that because electrons interact, a crazy number of things can happen. New kinds of behaviors are constantly being discovered by theory or experiment, and that keeps this field very dynamic and exciting. This is mostly fundamental research, but in many cases there are connections to exciting applications which are being explored at IQIM. It’s a nice place to be to keep track of everything that’s going on outside my own research, and the atmosphere on campus is amazing.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,When I’m not working on theoretical physics, I like to put my energy into athletic activities, and I like going to the campus gym after work. My favorite sports is cycling and living in Pasadena is really ideal for that. The weather is great and we have these beautiful mountains so close to us. I take my road bike up there for a longer ride almost every weekend."
"Johannes Pollanen,“I was not very good at physics right away in high school or even in college, but I did think it was really cool and I wanted to learn more and get better at it. The more I stuck with it, the more I realized how much I love figuring stuff out, and the excitement of that has never gone away. Now that I’m at the forefront of quantum physics, I get to answer questions and make advances that no one has done before. It’s a really satisfying feeling.”,Assistant Professor of Physics, Michigan State University,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus in Condensed Matter Physics,Eisenstein Group,PhD, 2012,Northwestern University,View my Videos,Interview,What is your current research?,I work in Jim Eisenstein’s group, where we explore the properties of various kinds of low dimensional electronic matter — we help put the “M” in IQIM. The specific system I study is a two-dimensional sheet of electrons that lives in a layered semiconductor structure. Imagine a layer cake of various semiconducting materials (gallium arsenide and aluminum gallium arsenide), and in one of these layers electrons are trapped in 2-dimensions. We subject this system to temperatures very near absolute zero (about 10 millikelvin) and large magnetic fields (up to 16 Tesla), and under these conditions this 2-d electron sheet is a highly quantum system. That’s interesting from two different perspectives. On the quantum information side, there are potentially ways to manipulate the electrons to perform tasks for quantum computation that might be protected from some of the random noise that can come in from outside and cause decoherence. Another big part of what we want to do is to understand, from a fundamental physics perspective, what happens in a system like this, in which quantum mechanics is extremely important. You take a bunch of electrons and cool them to very low temperatures and subject them to strong magnetic fields — what do they do? The interactions between electrons become very important, and they can form new quantum mechanical states of matter, and those are the ones we want to understand.,What drew you to this work?,I was not very good at physics right away in high school or even in college, but I did think it was really cool and I wanted to learn more and get better at it.

Now that I’m at the forefront of quantum physics, I get to answer questions and make advances that no one has done before.  It’s a really satisfying feeling.  I also really enjoy the mix of day-to-day activities that go on in the lab. Designing experiments, running them, analyzing the data, presenting the results in papers and at conferences — every day is different, and I like that aspect. Working in the IQIM has also been really great because of the focus on quantum information as well as fundamental physics, so I’ve gotten a chance to grow in multiple directions.,What do you do when you’re not doing physics?,My hobby is middle and long-distance running. In grad school, I was really into the marathon distance, but as a post-doc I’ve been focusing on shorter distances– mostly 5K and 10K races– and I’ve started racing the mile on the track for the first time.  It’s extremely different, and that actually makes it fun. I never realized until now how much strategy goes into it."
"Hechen Ren,“One of the things I love about physics is when it works. As a researcher, you slowly acquire a trained appreciation for when things work. You start with a curiosity about a subject that is born out of ignorance, and then with most things, as you learn, the itch gets scratched, and you feel satisfied. For really interesting matters, however, your curiosity thrives as your knowledge grows, so you keep digging deeper, and the pursuit becomes a self-driving interest. Physics for me is one of the latter kind.”,Industry Position,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus, 2019,Nadj-Perge Group,Email,Website,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,My current work is a continuation from my PhD where I studied combining topological materials with superconductivity with potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computing. Quantum computing includes both classical noise and quantum noise along two axes, and error correction gets a lot more loaded, so we want to figure out how we can protect our cubits from unwanted noise.,The condensed matter community wants to construct an emergent particle know as a Majorana fermion. Currently these particles are proposed by theorists, but once we create the environment where they emerge, we will be able to manipulate them and eventually do logic gates. Marjoana fermions are made of electrons, but you need to have electrons with special interactions. As an experimentalist, I work to construct materials to create the special environment where this particle emerges. Our work combines superconductors with some system that is spinless. A ferromagnetic environment is one place to look for these particles, but that is hard because ferromagnetism competes with superconductivity, so we look at systems with strong spin-orbit couplings.,All of the Majorana fermion searching used to be in 1D systems like nanowires or an atom chain, but recently we’ve realized that you can do this in 2D systems, which really opens up the opportunities. People keep discovering new 2D systems because it’s a very exciting field right now. These systems are wonderful for research because they are robust, and you can mass-produce them.,In our fridge, we do electrical measurements in high magnetic fields at very low temperatures, as low as 10 millikelvins, because quantum states need to be resolved with sufficiently low noise.,Our lab also does scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). When you have competing phases of matter, the competing phases can create order parameters that oscillate in space, which we can potentially observe with a scanning probe of spectroscopy. With STM, the surface has to be atomically clean, and you cannot have a large height difference. STM is very picky about the process your device sees, which is why it is a very ambitious project, but the payoff is also very promising. With STM, you can search an inhomogeneous system with the tip of the probe and see where you have an ideal environment for the particle and where you do not. STM is really as much a measurement tool as it is a diagnostic tool.,What drew you to this work?,Exploring novel materials with the grand goal of topological superconducting in mind is exciting, and while applying the research in topological quantum computing is a goal, I think the physics is richer than that. This research is a very good excuse to learn a lot about new materials. People study a lot of materials with the hope that they are topological in nature, but then in their research, they learn more fascinating things about the materials. Thinking about clever ways to do quantum computing that are more energy efficient intrigues me. These new ways are clever because you can braid particles around each other and create a memory with the braiding, and the scaling is totally awesome compared to conventional computing.,I decided to go into physics as an undergrad because of Philip Kim, who was then a professor at Columbia. I was looking for a summer research opportunity, and because he was one of the founding fathers of graphene research, I joined the Kim group. I had the opportunity to work with Andrea Young and Cory Dean who are both renowned faculty in condensed matter research now.,One of the things I love about physics is when it works. As a researcher, you slowly acquire a trained appreciation for when things work. You start with a curiosity about a subject that is born out of ignorance. For most things, as you learn about it, the itch gets scratched, and you feel satisfied. But for really interesting matters, your curiosity thrives as your knowledge grows, so you keep digging deeper, and the pursuit becomes a self-driving interest. Physics for me is one of the latter kind. And then you really get to know the art of experimentation, which is also amazing. If you do not know the art, then you cannot appreciate the work as much. This work is very specialized. It is both learning and getting frustrated, but after you get frustrated, you appreciate it more. You see how hard this work is, and then you appreciate when you can learn anything about any system given how many obstacles are on the road. And given that most experiments do fail, when you get something that works or teaches you something, you appreciate that.,Over time, you become more skilled at making your system teach you something, even when it is a failure. You get into something and the more you learn about it, the more it drags you into it. In physics, there is a test at the end of the day. Does this really describe this world and the universe that we live in? If it cannot be tested and if it cannot fail, there is no thrill when it works. It is only when something can fail, that you feel so happy when it succeeds.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,I’ve done some easy painting to decorate my walls, and since I am fairly new to California, I have a list of things that I am looking forward to doing, like going to concerts and checking out the horse racing at Santa Anita. When I lived in New York, I really enjoyed visiting museums and getting cheap student tickets to the Lincoln Center. It was like heaven to be an undergrad in New York City. I am slowly making friends at Caltech and around Pasadena, among which are some hiking enthusiasts. With my outdoor companions, I’m hoping to enjoy getting out on the trails and maybe the golf courses as well."

It has a nice combinatorial aspect and a nice geometric aspect to it, and that’s what makes it compelling to me. There are some really neat tricks and ideas that you can apply to address these fundamental questions.”,Research Staff member – IBM, 2015,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumnus,Preskill,and,Vidick,Groups,Email,Contact,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,Suppose someone gives you a fully working quantum computer — what processes or programs are you going to run on it? I work on developing quantum algorithms to simulate quantum physics, which can’t be modeled using a classical computer. I look at what kinds of physical systems you can simulate, and how quantum algorithms can be used to compute certain quantities in condensed matter systems. One formal aspect that I study involves Markovian quantum processes, which are memoryless in the same sense as a random walk: the next step never depends on the prior trajectory. Because of this property, these processes make good thermal noise models for quantum mechanical systems, which is important for quantum computing because we want to be able to design memories that are robust to noise and protected from decoherence. If you put a quantum state into the system, you want it to be stable for a long time. These quantum Markovian processes can be used to describe noisy evolution on that system to some extent. Whether you’re interested in developing algorithms or in trying to design these memories that can withstand noise, one central question is how long it will take for a process to converge, and I have been developing a general framework to estimate that convergence time. Since arriving at IQIM, I have also started to look more in a topological direction at particular models for memory, which is interesting from a condensed matter point of view as well.,What drew you to this work?,I love the way this research topic incorporates a lot of different strategies and tools, and I find that really aesthetically pleasing. It has a nice combinatorial aspect and a nice geometric aspect to it, and that’s what makes it compelling to me. There are some really neat tricks and ideas that you can apply to address these fundamental questions. The subset of topics I’m interested in also seems to crop up in different areas of research all the time, and it’s always nice to see your work being used for a variety of applications. I’ve gotten to learn a lot about adjacent fields, and the environment at IQIM encourages communication and collaboration, which also makes for a very relaxed and stimulating atmosphere.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,When I’m not working, I spend most of my time with my family. I have two young daughters, so there’s a lot of playing, diaper changes, the usual life stuff. I also picked up surfing since we moved to Los Angeles, and when I have the time I go down to the beach on Sunday mornings when the traffic is pretty light to go surfing for a bit. I love how easy it is to get out of the city, and it’s really great how many National Parks are accessible around here. Many of them are close enough to visit on a weekend or even a day trip, and I really enjoy that. Other than these things, I read a lot when I have spare time, although that tends to vary with family and work responsibilities quite a bit."

All of that appealed to me.”,Research Associate, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore,Alumni, IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar in Physics,Eisenstein Group,PhD, 2012,Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore,View my Videos,Back to Directory,Interview,What is your current research?,I’m studying graphene, a unique material made up of a single layer of carbon atoms. It conducts heat and electricity very well and is the thinnest and strongest material we know of, so it has many potential applications. It has many other bizarre and intriguing properties, and the scientists who were the first to prepare it in a single layer and describe some of its unusual characteristics won the 2010 Nobel Prize in physics. My experiments focus on how electrons move and interact in graphene, a phenomenon we don’t understand very well. We’d like to know whether their behavior is correlated—in other words, if you have electron movement over here, does it affect what electrons are doing over there, and how do the electrons influence each other across these distances? This is fundamental physics research, but gaining a deeper understanding of graphene’s electrical properties will also help us to envision and develop applications.,What drew you to this work?,In high school I knew that I wanted to study physics, and in college I was originally attracted to astrophysics and quantum field theory—you know, you read popular science books and everyone wants to be Feynman! But soon after I started my master’s program at IISc I did my first condensed matter physics experiment, and discovered how much I enjoyed the whole process—the hands-on aspect of preparing your own samples, collaborating across disciplines with materials scientists, and looking at the properties of new materials where you really don’t know what you’re going to find. All of that appealed to me.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,Back in Bangalore I was very active with a program called Notebook Drive that creates educational opportunities for underprivileged children. We teach in the primary schools and provide them with books, take students on science field trips, and organize other activities to encourage them to stay in school. After getting my PhD I spent several months working on a project jointly funded by the Indian government and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a lab-on-a chip diagnostic device for use in rural India. Since coming to Caltech, I’ve been involved in Caltech OASIS (Organization of Associated Students of the Indian Subcontinent).

"Ling Wang,“In the last few years, fresh approaches have been developed to investigate these truly strange states of matter, and I like being a pioneer in a new area where you can make discoveries that haven’t been accessible before.”,Assistant Professor at Beijing Computational Science Research Center,IQIM Postdoctoral Scholar Alumna, September 2015,Motrunich,and,Preskill,Groups,Interview,What is your current research?,I work in condensed matter theory, specializing in computational simulations of strongly correlated quantum systems.  What interests me are the exotic states of matter that can emerge from the strong interactions among the particles, such as electrons or ions, that make up these systems.  These include high-temperature superconductors, one dimensional electron arrays, and exotic particles that have promise as elements in quantum computing.  These systems have unusual characteristics, and modeling them has been a formidable problem in physics.  My research involves developing simple, workable models that can improve our ability to understand and predict their properties and behavior.,What drew you to this work?,I became interested in theory when I was an undergraduate at Zhejiang University in China. I liked the fact that as a theorist you can work independently, and I found using numerical methods and computational simulations to work through problems very satisfying.  Also, like many physicists who go into theory, I never felt I was too good with laboratory equipment, so that seemed to rule out experimental physics! In graduate school I decided to focus on strongly correlated systems in condensed matter theory because it was a new field with a lot of potential for doing original work. In the last few years, fresh approaches have been developed to investigate these truly strange states of matter, and I like being a pioneer in a new area where you can make discoveries that haven’t been accessible before.,What are you doing when you are not doing physics?,As a fulltime researcher and a new mom, I don’t have a great deal of free time.  I like exercising and being active—playing badminton and hiking­—and being with close friends. While I was a postdoc at the University of Vienna, I became interested in the opera and was able to attend performances often because of the special discounts they offer to students.  It’s a classic and accessible art form that I enjoy very much and which allows me to relax."
