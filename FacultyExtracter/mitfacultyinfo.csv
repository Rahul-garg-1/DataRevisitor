Dr. Anikeeva's Ph.D. thesis focussed on physical properties and design of light emitting devices based on organic materials and nanoparticles, working under the supervision of Prof. Vladimir Bulovic in EECS. She previously held the Dean's Postdoctoral Fellowship, School of Medicine, Stanford and was in the group of Prof. Karl Deisseroth in the Department of Bioengineering. Her current research is focused on development of optoelectronic and magnetic materials and devices for recording and modulating activity of neurons in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral organs.,When asked to describe her research interests, Dr. Anikeeva writes, ""My research interests lie within the field of,Bioelectronics,, and specifically the development of materials and devices that enable recording and manipulation of signaling processes within the nervous system. Our ability to understand the dynamics of neural circuits and develop treatments for neurological (Parkinson’s, paraplegia) and psychiatric (depression) conditions is currently handicapped by the technology available for interacting with the electrical, chemical, and mechanical signaling modalities used by neurons. Today, neural probes remain limited in both function and longevity as they fail to communicate with the neural tissue across its signaling palette for extended periods of time. ....By combining physical modeling, materials synthesis and device fabrication with understanding of electrophysiological and anatomical structure of neural circuits, my group aspires to create enabling tools for systems neuroscience as well as advance the development of future neuroprosthetics."" She is enthusiastic about pursuing her research interests at MIT, where collaborations between colleagues, departments, and schools create innovations almost daily.,She explains that, ""While research is a very significant part, of my life, I cannot possibly imagine a fulfilling career without teaching. My goal, as a teacher, is to infect the students with my curiosity for materials science and to inspire them to become future academic and industry leaders in the field."" Every Spring she teaches core undergraduate course 3.024 ""Electronic, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of Materials"" that takes students on a math-packed journey throught the structure-property relations governing optoelectronics and magnetism. In the Fall she teaches an advanced design course 3.156/3.46 ""Photonic Materials and Devices"" that allows students to engineer realistic photonic devices such as lasers, solar cells, and optical fibers."

As of today, it is therefore of critical importance to develop innovative approaches to cope with both increasing materials needs and earth intrinsic limitations.,Prof. Allanore’s research applies to the development of,sustainable materials extraction and manufacturing process.,His predilection processing methods rely on, but are not limited to, using electricity as a mean to provide energetically efficient processes. Each research project combines theoretical approach (e.g., how does the flow of current can affect the performance of an electrolytic process) and phenomenological approach (e.g. what are the actual lab performance of the foreseen electrolytic process).,For mining,, one approach consists in developing processing methods that provide maximum use of the elements composing the ore while minimize water usage, chemicals consumption and the amount of residue. In the field of,metal extraction,, the research focuses on developing innovative processes with higher productivity and metal quality, while targeting minimization of energy consumption and waste generation. On the,manufacturing,front, the current research aims at providing manufacturing methods that reduces the number of unit-operations, ultimately increasing the productivity and limiting the scrap-rate of manufacture-intensive business."

He later went on to the University of Texas at Austin as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Physics and the Texas Materials Institute where he made important discoveries in magnetization dynamics and spin-transfer torque in nanoscale magnetic structures. His current research interests focus on spin dynamics and “spin-electronics” in nanoscale magnetic materials and devices. Developing ways to store information more densely and to access it more quickly requires understanding the magnetization configurations in nanoscale structures and how they evolve in time. His work aims in part to understand and control spin excitations in magnetic materials whose dimensions approach fundamental magnetic length scales. One of the most exciting prospects in magnetism today is the possibility of electrical control of the magnetic state of a device, taking advantage of the coupling between spin and charge in a conducting ferromagnetic material. A major thrust of his research aims to harness the spin of the electron in magnetic materials to realize new approaches to spin-based storage and computation. Studying these processes requires the development of advanced instrumentation capable of probing magnetization dynamics at the shortest timescales and the smallest length scales. His group will work to develop new optical and electrical approaches to push the detection limits in order to enable development of new materials and structures to meet the information storage and processing demands of the future."

He later moved to the Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielle (Paris, France) as a CNRS postdoctoral researcher to study charged polymer solutions and their self-assembly with direct applications to fuel cells. His current interests lie in the realm of self-assembly and dynamics of biological soft-materials using a combination of analytical theory and simulations. His group is particularly focused in designing novel polymer-like drug delivery carriers and understanding their response to chemical and physical stimuli. This work aims to enable a new generation of drug-delivery vectors that could target different areas of the body in a very specific manner, and to provide a much deeper understanding of the processes of adhesion and targeting in flow. Other topics that he is currently pursuing is understanding the supramolecular self-assembly of chlorophyls in the antennas of Photosynthetic Bacteria which are the most efficient light harvesting organisms on Earth, as well as studying the dynamics of driven soft systems in general.

Much of the group's efforts are focused on lattice-mismatched semiconductor systems, in which layers in electronic materials and devices have different lattice parameters. Such material combinations have potential in printing, storage, display, communications, and interconnect applications. But the utility of these materials depends on our ability to understand and eliminate crystalline defects which can be generated due to the lattice-mismatch between semiconductor layers. Current projects involve the fabrication of GeSi/Si detectors and InGaAs/GaAs emitters which may be used in fiber-to-the-home applications; GeSi/Si structures for integrated, micro-mechanical devices; visible AlInGaP LEDs and lasers integrated on Si and GaAs; III-V microwave transistors integrated on Si; III-V solar cells integrated on Si; basic studies concerning the generation, propagation, and interaction of defects in these heterostructures; and investigations of microscopic failure mechanisms in optoelectronic and electronic devices."

Fibers are among the earliest forms of human expression, yet surprisingly have remained unchanged from ancient to modern times. Can fibers become highly functional devices? Can they see, hear, sense and communicate? Fink’s research group,,fibers@mit,, focuses on extending the frontiers of fiber materials from optical transmission to encompass electronic, optoelectronic and even acoustic properties. What makes these fibers unique is the combination of a multiplicity of disparate materials arranged in elaborate geometries with features down to 10 nanometers. Two complementary approaches towards realizing sophisticated functions are utilized: on the single-fiber level, the integration of a multiplicity of functional components into one fiber, and on the multiple-fiber level, the assembly of large-scale fiber arrays and fabrics. Fink’s multimaterial fibers offer unprecedented control over material properties and function on length scales spanning the nanometer to kilometer range."

Her primary research currently is at the site of El Manchón, Guerrero, in West Mexico, where extensive copper smelting activities took place. She and her colleagues are currently working on dating the smelting area of that site. They are also examining the production of a variety of unusual prehispanic copper-based alloy objects recently excavated in the state of Mexico. Her general interests in production extend to rubber and pottery production in ancient Mesoamerica and to construction technologies in Mesoamerica.,Current Research in Guerrero,Prof. Hosler's 1999 survey of the Balsas region of Guerrero identified six metalworking sites, the most significant of which is La Barrranca de la Fundiciones (see Hosler 2003a, b). This site is located at 1400 meters in the Sierra Madre del Sur de Guerrero. The site covers about 1 kilometer and consists of three physically distinct areas: two zones contain long low rectangular structures (3-8m long) that may have served as house foundations or for other activities. Copper smelting took place in a third physically separate area where large accumulations of slag and disturbed furnace structures appear. We have completed excavations at the site and have analyzed the slag in the laboratories at MIT. Initial dates from both the smelting area and from the mounds suggest occupation around 1200–1300AD. Ethnic affiliations of these people cannot  be determined. After four 8-12 week field seasons work at the site halted due to dangerous political/social circumstances in 2010. We have carried out extensive laboratory work on the pottery and smelting technologies and materials.  La Barranca de Las Fundiciones is the first ancient copper-smelting site yet identified in Mesoamerica.,Other Research,The Spring 2008 issue of the Journal of Anthropological Research reported research on oceangoing rafts and traderoutes in pre-Columbian South and Central America; this research was performed by Prof. Hosler and Leslie Dewan, former MIT undergraduate (see the,MIT News Office,for the full story, March 19, 2008). Leslie Dewan is currently a MIT Ph.D. student in the Department of Nuclear Science & Engineering.,A facsimile raft conforming to original dimensions and made from original materials was constructed at MIT as a component of the laboratory class, Materials in Human Experience. The raft was launched in the Charles River in Spring 2009.,In 2012 Prof. Hosler traveled to Sucre, Bolivia for a three month course in intensive Quechua to explore the possiblity of enthnographic field work among local mining communities. Work in indigenous Bolivian communities has become difficult in the last several years due to political concerns and presumably will resolve in the near future."

Engineering honeycombs and foams can now be made from nearly any material: polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses and composites, with pore sizes ranging from nanometers to millimeters. Their cellular structure gives rise to a unique combination of properties which are exploited in engineering design: their low weight make them attractive for structural sandwich panels, their ability to undergo large deformations at relatively low stresses make them ideal for absorbing the energy of impacts, their low thermal conductivity make them excellent insulators, and their high specific surface area make them attractive for substrates for catalysts for chemical reactions. Cellular materials are increasingly used in biomedical applications. Open-cell titantium foams are being developed to replace trabecular bone. Porous scaffolds for regeneration of damaged or diseased tissues often resemble an open-cell foam. Cellular materials are also widespread in nature in plant and animal tissues: examples include wood, cork, plant parenchyma, trabecular bone and lung alveoli.,Our group has contributed to the understanding of the mechanics of cellular solids, as well as to their use in many of the above applications.

Synthetic materials can be applied in two major ways to 'immunobioengineering': (1) Synthetic materials can modulate the function of immune cells by mimicking signals derived from the immune system or foreign pathogens, both as a probe for cell function and as a tool for immunotherapy— both in vitro and in vivo; (2) Synthetic materials can be used to create in vitro and in vivo models of the microenvironment present in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, to better understand immunobiology in health and disease. To meet these goals, engineering must be married to an in-depth appreciation for the biology of these problems. Their laboratory is thus deeply interdisciplinary in every project. Key to their approach is a balanced emphasis on both the engineering and immunological aspects of the problems the Irvine group has chosen to address: In each of these projects, state of the art chemistry, polymer science, physics and immunology are combined to address critical biological questions and medical challenges."

Her area of specialty is prehistoric Andean metallurgy. Professor Lechtman’s research has demonstrated that the Andean zone of South America was the locus of what became, over time, a pan-Andean set of metallurgical technologies that developed first in the Andes and later was transmitted to societies farther north. The Andean culture area was one of the primary zones for the development of sophisticated metallurgical practice in the ancient world. Professor Lechtman’s current research involves investigation of the range of unusual bronze alloys Andean peoples designed long before the establishment of the Inka state."

Composites of these materials could result in powerful synthesis schemes for fabricating materials with controllable emergent properties, but a fundamental challenge in this area of research is developing self-assembly approaches to create polymer and nanoparticle composite materials where nanoscale order can be generated in a predictable and controllable manner. Research in the Macfarlane lab is focused on developing a set of design principles for synthesizing new inorganic/organic composite materials, where nanoscale structure can be manipulated to tune the emergent physical properties of a bulk material. These structures have the potential to significantly impact energy-related research via light manipulation (e.g. photonic band gaps or plasmonic metamaterials), electronic device fabrication (e.g. semiconducting substrates or data storage devices), and environmental and medical research (e.g. hydrogels for sustained drug delivery)."

However, they also suffer the most severe timescale limitations.  For instance, in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in order to resolve atomic vibrations, the integration time step is limited to hundredth of a picosecond, and therefore the simulation duration is limited to sub-microsecond due to computational cost. Although a nanosecond simulation is often enough (surprisingly) for many physical and chemical properties, it is usually insufficient for predicting microstructural evolution and thermo-mechanical properties of materials. There is clearly a timescale barrier between science-based simulations and practical demands such as understanding plant reliability and nuclear waste storage.,Energy Storage and Conversion,A close coupling of,in situ,experimental observations with modeling has proven to be a powerful paradigm for understanding materials behavior [,Science,330 (2010) 1515;,Nature,463 (2010) 335].  Based on such fundamental understandings, we are developing novel nanostructured materials for energy storage and conversion, in applications such as batteries, fuel cells and hydrogen-embrittlement resistant steels.,Materials in Extreme Environments and Far from Equilibrium,Materials in nuclear fission and fusion applications often involve exceptionally high stresses, high temperature and high radiation flux.

Such systems have developed hierarchical and heterogeneous composite structures over millions of years of evolution in order to sustain the mechanical loads experienced in their specific environment. For this reason, they have enjoyed a long and distinguished history in the literature of more than a century with an emphasis on macroscopic, continuum-level biomechanics. The Ortiz research group studies these fascinating materials using expertise in the field of "",nanomechanics,,"" including the measurement and prediction of extremely small forces and displacements, the quantification of nanoscale spatially-varying mechanical properties, the identification of local constitutive laws, the formulation of molecular-level structure-property relationships, and the investigation of new mechanical phenomena existing at small length scales. Novel experimental and theoretical methods are employed, involving increasing levels of complexity from individual molecules to biomimetic molecular assemblies to the matrix associated with single cells and, lastly, to the nanoscale properties of the intact tissue. The result, and ultimate objective of the Ortiz research program, is a fundamental, mechanistic-based understanding of tissue function, quality, and pathology. The scientific foundation being formed has relevance to both the medical and engineering fields. Nanotechnological methods applied to the field of musculoskeletal tissues and tissue engineering hold great promise for significant and rapid advancements towards tissue repair and/or replacement, improved treatments, and possibly even a cure for people afflicted with diseases such as osteoarthritis. In addition, the discovery of new nanoscale design principles and energy-dissipating mechanisms will enable the production of improved and increasingly advanced biologically-inspired structural engineering materials and protective defense technologies that exhibit "",mechanical property amplification,""—that is, dramatic improvements in mechanical properties (e.g., increases in strength and toughness) for a material relative to its constituents.

She focuses on thermodynamically metastable surfaces and interfaces, in which stress-assisted chemical reaction kinetics are notoriously difficult to analyze via either experiment or simulation. The mechanisms of this coupling in cell-material interactions are incompletely understood, due to both biological complexity and lack of appropriate experimental and computational tools, but are key to design of materials that modulate cell adhesion for drug uptake and differentiation. Her long-term goal is to predict and modulate key functions of biological cells by drawing analogies to the coupled chemical/mechanical behavior of structurally simpler, nonbiological material interfaces and nanocomposites. These integrated experimental and computational efforts include three main thrusts: (1) chemomechanical mapping of nanocomposite surfaces including living cells; (2) mechanics of amorphous and viscoelastic surfaces and nanostructures; and (3) chemical kinetics in mechanically strained, nanoscale material interfaces.
