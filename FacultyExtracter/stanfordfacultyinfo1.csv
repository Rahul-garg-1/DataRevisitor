"The Melosh group explores how to apply new methods from the semiconductor and self-assembly fields to important problems in biology, materials, and energy. We think about how to rationally design engineered interfaces to enhance communication with biological cells and tissues, or to improve energy conversion and materials synthesis. In particular, we are interested in seamlessly integrating inorganic structures together with biology for improved cell transfection and therapies, and designing new materials, often using diamondoid molecules as building blocks.,My group is very interested in how to design new inorganic structures that will seamless integrate with biological systems to address problems that are not feasible by other means. This involves both fundamental work such as to deeply understand how lipid membranes interact with inorganic surfaces, electrokinetic phenomena in biologically relevant solutions, and applying this knowledge into new device designs. Examples of this include “nanostraw” drug delivery platforms for direct delivery or extraction of material through the cell wall using a biomimetic gap-junction made using nanoscale semiconductor processing techniques. We also engineer materials and structures for neural interfaces and electronics pertinent to highly parallel data acquisition and recording. For instance, we have created inorganic electrodes that mimic the hydrophobic banding of natural transmembrane proteins, allowing them to ‘fuse’ into the cell wall, providing a tight electrical junction for solid-state patch clamping. In addition to significant efforts at engineering surfaces at the molecular level, we also work on ‘bridge’ projects that span between engineering and biological/clinical needs. My long history with nano- and microfabrication techniques and their interactions with biological constructs provide the skills necessary to fabricate and analyze new bio-electronic systems.,Research Interests:,Bio-inorganic Interface,Molecular materials at interfaces,Self-Assembly and Nucleation and Growth,Education,PhD, University of California at Santa Barbara, Materials Science and Engineering  (2001),BS, Harvey Mudd College, Chemistry  (1996),Contact,nmelosh@stanford.edu,Mail Code,4034,Links,Group lab site,View Full Stanford Profile"

"The availability of low-cost but intermittent renewable electricity (e.g., derived from solar and wind) underscores the grand challenge to store and dispatch energy so that it is available when and where it is needed. Redox-active materials promise the efficient transformation between electrical, chemical, and thermal energy, and are at the heart of carbon-neutral energy cycles. Understanding design rules that govern materials chemistry and architecture holds the key towards rationally optimizing technologies such as batteries, fuel cells, electrolyzers, and novel thermodynamic cycles. Electrochemical and chemical reactions involved in these technologies span diverse length and time scales, ranging from Ångströms to meters and from picoseconds to years. As such, establishing a unified, predictive framework has been a major challenge. The central question unifying our research is: “can we understand and engineer redox reactions at the levels of electrons, ions, molecules, particles and devices using a bottom-up approach?” Our approach integrates novel synthesis, fabrication, characterization, modeling and analytics to understand molecular pathways and interfacial structure, and to bridge fundamentals to energy storage and conversion technologies by establishing new design rules.,Education,PhD, Caltech, Materials Science  (2010),BS, Caltech, Applied Physics  (2005),Contact,(650) 725-7515,wchueh@stanford.edu,Mail Code,4034,Links,The Chueh Group,Stanford Energy Professional Certificate Program,View Full Stanford Profile"

He became professor of electrical engineering in 1983.,His career at Stanford has included serving as director of the IC Laboratory, senior associate dean in the School of Engineering, and chair of the Electrical Engineering Department. He was the Frederick Emmons Terman Dean of the School of Engineering from 1999 until 2014. He also holds the John Fluke Professorship in Electrical Engineering. During his tenure as dean, the school renewed or replaced much of its laboratory and classroom space, dramatically increased the number of undergraduate students majoring in engineering and created interdisciplinary programs like the Bioengineering Department, which is jointly operated with the medical school, ICME, the Institute For Computational and Mathematical Engineering, and the Hasso Plattner Institute of Design (d.school) that changed the nature of engineering education. Plummer was a strong advocate as dean, for ensuring that engineering majors take advantage of the full set of opportunities at a liberal arts institution like Stanford.,Plummer has worked in a variety of areas in the broad field of silicon devices and technology. Much of his early work focused on high-voltage ICs and on high-voltage device structures. He and his group made important contributions to integrating CMOS logic and high-voltage lateral DMOS devices on the same chip and demonstrated circuits operating at several hundred volts. This work also led to several power MOS device concepts such as the IGBT which have become important power switching devices.,Throughout the 1980s and '90s, a major focus of his work was on silicon process modeling. This work involved many students and other faculty, particularly Professor Bob Dutton, and resulted in the development of several generations of SUPREM, which has become the standard process modeling tool used worldwide today. His recent work has focused on nanoscale silicon devices for logic and memory and has demonstrated new device concepts such as the TRAM thyristor based memory cell and the IMOS device which achieves <kT/q subthreshold slopes.His recent work has also focused on power devices using wide bandgap semiconductor materials.,Plummer is a member of the National Academy of Engineering, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a fellow of the IEEE. He has received many awards for his research, including the 1991 Gordon Moore medal for Solid State Science and Technology from the Electrochemical Society, the 2001 Semiconductor Industry Association University Research Award, the 2003 IEEE J. J. Ebers Award, the 2003 IEEE Van der Ziel Award, the 2007 IEEE Andrew Grove award and the 2015 IEEE Founders Award.He has been elected to the Silicon Valley and ISPSD Halls of Fame.,He has graduated more than 90 PhD students with whom he has published more than 400 journal papers and conference presentations. These papers have won eight conference and student best paper awards including two at IEDM and three at ISSCC. His textbook, ""Silicon VLSI Technology: Fundamentals, Practice and Modeling,"" is used by many universities around the world. He has also received three teaching awards at Stanford. He has served and currently serves on the Board of Directors of several public companies including Intel and Cadence.,Plummer directed the Stanford Nanofabrication Facility from 1994 to 2000 and received an NSF commendation in 2000 for national leadership in building the NNUN, a consortium of universities who opened their nanofabrication facilities as national resources for industry and for students from around the nation.,Education,PhD, Stanford, Electrical Engineering  (1971),MS, Stanford, Electrical Engineering  (1967),BS, UCLA, Electrical Engineering  (1966),Contact,(650) 725-3606,plummer@stanford.edu,Mail Code,4075,View Full Stanford Profile"
