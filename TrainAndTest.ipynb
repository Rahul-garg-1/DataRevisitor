She previously held the Dean\\'s Postdoctoral Fellowship, School of Medicine, Stanford and was in the group of Prof. Karl Deisseroth in the Department of Bioengineering. Her current research is focused on development of optoelectronic and magnetic materials and devices for recording and modulating activity of neurons in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral organs.,When asked to describe her research interests, Dr. Anikeeva writes, \"My research interests lie within the field of,Bioelectronics,, and specifically the development of materials and devices that enable recording and manipulation of signaling processes within the nervous system. Our ability to understand the dynamics of neural circuits and develop treatments for neurological (Parkinson’s, paraplegia) and psychiatric (depression) conditions is currently handicapped by the technology available for interacting with the electrical, chemical, and mechanical signaling modalities used by neurons. Today, neural probes remain limited in both function and longevity as they fail to communicate with the neural tissue across its signaling palette for extended periods of time. ....By combining physical modeling, materials synthesis and device fabrication with understanding of electrophysiological and anatomical structure of neural circuits, my group aspires to create enabling tools for systems neuroscience as well as advance the development of future neuroprosthetics.\" She is enthusiastic about pursuing her research interests at MIT, where collaborations between colleagues, departments, and schools create innovations almost daily.,She explains that, \"While research is a very significant part, of my life, I cannot possibly imagine a fulfilling career without teaching. My goal, as a teacher, is to infect the students with my curiosity for materials science and to inspire them to become future academic and industry leaders in the field.\" Every Spring she teaches core undergraduate course 3.024 \"Electronic, Optical, and Magnetic Properties of Materials\" that takes students on a math-packed journey throught the structure-property relations governing optoelectronics and magnetism. In the Fall she teaches an advanced design course 3.156/3.46 \"Photonic Materials and Devices\" that allows students to engineer realistic photonic devices such as lasers, solar cells, and optical fibers.',\n",

As of today, it is therefore of critical importance to develop innovative approaches to cope with both increasing materials needs and earth intrinsic limitations.,Prof. Allanore’s research applies to the development of,sustainable materials extraction and manufacturing process.,His predilection processing methods rely on, but are not limited to, using electricity as a mean to provide energetically efficient processes. Each research project combines theoretical approach (e.g., how does the flow of current can affect the performance of an electrolytic process) and phenomenological approach (e.g. what are the actual lab performance of the foreseen electrolytic process).,For mining,, one approach consists in developing processing methods that provide maximum use of the elements composing the ore while minimize water usage, chemicals consumption and the amount of residue. In the field of,metal extraction,, the research focuses on developing innovative processes with higher productivity and metal quality, while targeting minimization of energy consumption and waste generation.

He later went on to the University of Texas at Austin as a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Physics and the Texas Materials Institute where he made important discoveries in magnetization dynamics and spin-transfer torque in nanoscale magnetic structures. His current research interests focus on spin dynamics and “spin-electronics” in nanoscale magnetic materials and devices. Developing ways to store information more densely and to access it more quickly requires understanding the magnetization configurations in nanoscale structures and how they evolve in time. His work aims in part to understand and control spin excitations in magnetic materials whose dimensions approach fundamental magnetic length scales. One of the most exciting prospects in magnetism today is the possibility of electrical control of the magnetic state of a device, taking advantage of the coupling between spin and charge in a conducting ferromagnetic material. A major thrust of his research aims to harness the spin of the electron in magnetic materials to realize new approaches to spin-based storage and computation. Studying these processes requires the development of advanced instrumentation capable of probing magnetization dynamics at the shortest timescales and the smallest length scales. His group will work to develop new optical and electrical approaches to push the detection limits in order to enable development of new materials and structures to meet the information storage and processing demands of the future.\",\n",

As an NSF International Postdoctoral Fellow, he moved to Munich to study the dynamics of driven polymers. His work in Munich led to an important discovery that unraveled the mystery behind the process of blood clotting at high shear rates and opened new routes for the development of novel shear responsive materials. He later moved to the Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielle (Paris, France) as a CNRS postdoctoral researcher to study charged polymer solutions and their self-assembly with direct applications to fuel cells. His current interests lie in the realm of self-assembly and dynamics of biological soft-materials using a combination of analytical theory and simulations. His group is particularly focused in designing novel polymer-like drug delivery carriers and understanding their response to chemical and physical stimuli. This work aims to enable a new generation of drug-delivery vectors that could target different areas of the body in a very specific manner, and to provide a much deeper understanding of the processes of adhesion and targeting in flow. Other topics that he is currently pursuing is understanding the supramolecular self-assembly of chlorophyls in the antennas of Photosynthetic Bacteria which are the most efficient light harvesting organisms on Earth, as well as studying the dynamics of driven soft systems in general.

Such material combinations have potential in printing, storage, display, communications, and interconnect applications. But the utility of these materials depends on our ability to understand and eliminate crystalline defects which can be generated due to the lattice-mismatch between semiconductor layers.

Fibers are among the earliest forms of human expression, yet surprisingly have remained unchanged from ancient to modern times. Can fibers become highly functional devices? Can they see, hear, sense and communicate? Fink’s research group,,fibers@mit,, focuses on extending the frontiers of fiber materials from optical transmission to encompass electronic, optoelectronic and even acoustic properties. What makes these fibers unique is the combination of a multiplicity of disparate materials arranged in elaborate geometries with features down to 10 nanometers. Two complementary approaches towards realizing sophisticated functions are utilized: on the single-fiber level, the integration of a multiplicity of functional components into one fiber, and on the multiple-fiber level, the assembly of large-scale fiber arrays and fabrics. Fink’s multimaterial fibers offer unprecedented control over material properties and function on length scales spanning the nanometer to kilometer range.\",\n",

Her primary research currently is at the site of El Manchón, Guerrero, in West Mexico, where extensive copper smelting activities took place. She and her colleagues are currently working on dating the smelting area of that site. They are also examining the production of a variety of unusual prehispanic copper-based alloy objects recently excavated in the state of Mexico. Her general interests in production extend to rubber and pottery production in ancient Mesoamerica and to construction technologies in Mesoamerica.,Current Research in Guerrero,Prof. Hosler's 1999 survey of the Balsas region of Guerrero identified six metalworking sites, the most significant of which is La Barrranca de la Fundiciones (see Hosler 2003a, b). This site is located at 1400 meters in the Sierra Madre del Sur de Guerrero. The site covers about 1 kilometer and consists of three physically distinct areas: two zones contain long low rectangular structures (3-8m long) that may have served as house foundations or for other activities. Copper smelting took place in a third physically separate area where large accumulations of slag and disturbed furnace structures appear. We have completed excavations at the site and have analyzed the slag in the laboratories at MIT. Initial dates from both the smelting area and from the mounds suggest occupation around 1200–1300AD. Ethnic affiliations of these people cannot\\xa0 be determined. After four 8-12 week field seasons work at the site halted due to dangerous political/social circumstances in 2010. We have carried out extensive laboratory work on the pottery and smelting technologies and materials.\\xa0 La Barranca de Las Fundiciones is the first ancient copper-smelting site yet identified in Mesoamerica.,Other Research,The Spring 2008 issue of the Journal of Anthropological Research reported research on oceangoing rafts and traderoutes in pre-Columbian South and Central America; this research was performed by Prof. Hosler and Leslie Dewan, former MIT undergraduate (see the,MIT News Office,for the full story, March 19, 2008).

Engineering honeycombs and foams can now be made from nearly any material: polymers, metals, ceramics, glasses and composites, with pore sizes ranging from nanometers to millimeters. Their cellular structure gives rise to a unique combination of properties which are exploited in engineering design: their low weight make them attractive for structural sandwich panels, their ability to undergo large deformations at relatively low stresses make them ideal for absorbing the energy of impacts, their low thermal conductivity make them excellent insulators, and their high specific surface area make them attractive for substrates for catalysts for chemical reactions. Cellular materials are increasingly used in biomedical applications. Open-cell titantium foams are being developed to replace trabecular bone. Porous scaffolds for regeneration of damaged or diseased tissues often resemble an open-cell foam. Cellular materials are also widespread in nature in plant and animal tissues: examples include wood, cork, plant parenchyma, trabecular bone and lung alveoli.,Our group has contributed to the understanding of the mechanics of cellular solids, as well as to their use in many of the above applications.

His group is exploring a wide range of microfabricated systems with particular emphasis on systems for which microfabrication provides unique process advantages in terms of novel processing conditions, manipulation of microstructure, and gain understanding of underlying physicochemical processes. For example, they exploit microfluidics in the synthesis of colloidal core-shell nanoparticles for optical, electronic, and catalytic applications at conditions difficult to achieve by conventional approaches. They also use detailed simulations of reactive systems, specifically simulation across multiple length and time scales, to complement experimental studies and gain new insight into the underlying basic physical and chemical rate processes.\",\n",
