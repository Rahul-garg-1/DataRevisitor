A detailed analysis of four important localities of Kashmir valley, namely, Anantnag, Baramulla, Kupwara and Srinagar, was also performed., The site response analysis of Kashmir valley during the 8 October 2005 Kashmir earthquake (M w 7...., more, , , The site response analysis of Kashmir valley during the 8 October 2005 Kashmir earthquake (M w 7.6) using the standard penetration test 'N value' (SPT N) geotechnical dataset is presented. Due to non-availability of the strong motion data records, synthetic ground motions at the bedrock level were generated at each borehole location by the stochastic finite fault method. The soil type-specific relationships between SPT N value and shear wave velocity were used to generate shear wave velocity profiles at each borehole site, which were later interpolated to map the shear wave velocity pattern in the Kashmir valley. The analyses revealed that site classes C and D of the NEHRP classification are dominant in the valley. The site response analysis conducted using the equivalent linear approach with DEEPSOIL showed that the local site conditions play an important role in the transmission of ground motion from the bedrock to the surface in the Kashmir valley, suggesting that it is imperative to consider the site effect in the seismic hazard assessment of the Kashmir valley.
