Jet Propulsion Laboratory
California Institute of Technology
I develop technologies to enable the next generation of deployable spacecraft structures. Currently, I work on both large structures such as starshade and small structures such as antennas for
CubeSats.
110/2011 - 06/2016 Graduate Student
Supervisor: Professor Sergio Pellegrino
Space Structures Laboratory
California Institute of Technology
I designed novel breakthrough schemes for the packaging and
deployment of large, thin space structures such as photovoltaic
arrays, solar sails, reflectors, and sunshields. I performed experiments on scale test articles, and developed analytical models to
capture observed behavior. I applied these methods for the preliminary design of a large spacecraft for a space solar power station.
As a side project, I developed and supervised the fabrication of an
engineering model of an optical camera for a mission to demonstrate key technologies for a reconfigurable space telescope.
05/2011 - 08/2011 Patent Agentâ€™s Assistant
Hill & Schumacher
Toronto
I drafted and prosecuted patents for a variety of clients, both
industrial and academic, in the fields of space robotics, polymer
chemistry, organometallic chemistry, medical devices, and others.
I submitted and prosecuted applications in the United States Patent
Office (USPTO), Canadian Intellectual Property Office (CIPO), and
the European Patent Office (EPO).
09/2010 - 04/2011 Undergraduate Thesis
Supervisor: Professor Chris Damaren
University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies
I examined the dynamics of solar sails, in particular the coupling
between the sail membrane dynamics and the attitude control system. I modelled the dynamics of the solar sail, and designed an
attitude controller to reduce sail membrane deflections. Numerical simulations demonstrated a fivefold reduction in peak sail deflection during test slew manÅ“uvres.

Supervisor: Professor Craig A. Steeves
Multifunctional Structures Laboratory
University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies
I analysed the propagation of acoustic waves in three-dimensional
periodic lattice structures using finite element methods and BlochFloquet principles. I used this analysis to create schemes for the
design of lattices with desired acoustic frequency bandgaps. Fur-
2ther, I implemented a C++ computer program to perform such
analyses for three-dimensional lattices with arbitrary topologies.
05/2009 - 09/2009 Lab Assistant
Supervisor: Dr. Reza Emami
University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies
I designed the mechanical system for a mechatronic device intended for patenting and commercialisation. I integrated the mechanical design with the electrical and computer systems of the device. I used CAD tools to model the mechanical system. I also created several working prototypes of the device as proof-of-concepts.
05/2008 - 09/2008 Research Assistant

My aim entails to learn two aspects of computational material modeling: 1) how to develop accurate and efficient modeling algorithms when the material properties depend on inherent scales that vary by orders of magnitude in length and time,
2) to explore how the next-generation multiscale algorithms can be best used to design new materials/structures having desired properties from molecular to continuum scales.

October 2016 â€“ October 2016 (1 month)Caltech
The Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF) program is one of the â€œcrown jewelsâ€ of Caltech. Since 1979, SURF students have had the opportunity to conduct research under the guidance of experienced mentors working at the frontiers of their fields. Students experience the process of research as a creative intellectual activity from beginning (defining and developing a project) to end (presenting their results at SURF Seminar Day).

Co-chair of the session on 'Adding Value in Office Hours: Attracting and Retaining Students' at the 4th Annual Teaching Conference held at Caltech. Session Description: Office hours are a crucial resource for students, providing them with a chance to clarify concepts and work through challenging problems. In fact, office hour attendance is often an excellent predictor of student engagement, motivation, and high final grades. However, students can often be nervous about attending office hours or may not see them as valuable. Come discuss effective methods to establish a welcoming environment and facilitate learning in your own office hours!
